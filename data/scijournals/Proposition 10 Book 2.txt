 Abstract In Proposition 10, Book 2 of the Principia , Newton applied his geomet-
 rical calculus and power series expansion to calculate motion in a resistive medium
 under the action of gravity. In the first edition of the Principia , however, he made

 an error in his treatment which lead to a faulty solution that was noticed by Johann

 Bernoulli and communicated to him while the second edition was already at the printer.

 This episode has been discussed in the past, and the source of Newton's initial error,
 which Bernoulli was unable to find, has been clarified by Lagrange and is reviewed
 here. But there are also problems in Newton's corrected version in the second edition

 of the Principia that have been ignored in the past, which are discussed in detail here.

 1 Introduction

 In his guide to Newton's Principia , I. B. Cohen writes that "anyone studying the
 history of the Principia will find Book 2, Proposition 10 to be of special interest. The

 problem is to find the density of the medium that makes a body move in any given curve

 under the supposition that gravity is uniform and of constant direction, and that the

 resistance of the medium varies jointly as the density of that medium and the square
 of the velocity. . . The proposition is notable, among other things, for a display of
 Newtonian fluxions (or "moments")" (Cohen 1999, 167). In an unpublished pref-
 ace to the Principia , written after the publication of the second edition, and during
 his priority dispute with Leibniz on the development of the calculus (Hall 1980),

 Newton called attention to this proposition and related ones,1 to give explicit examples

 where he had applied his method of analysis.2 It turns out, however, that his approach

 was solely based on his geometrical approach to the calculus and on his power series
 expansion, without any reference to fluxions.3 Moreover, in the first edition of the

 Principia, he made a mistake in this proposition, which came back to haunt him dur-

 ing this dispute. On September 1712, Newton received Nikolaus Bernoulli, who came

 with some upsetting news from his uncle Johann Bernoulli. The elder Bernoulli had

 found a "serious error" in the first example that Newton gave for Proposition 10, Book

 2 in the case that the motion occurred along a circular path. For this case, Newton had

 found that the component of gravity along the motion exactly balanced the resistance,

 which implied that the velocity is a constant. But this result is inconsistent with his

 calculation that the velocity decreases as the square root of the vertical distance along
 the circular path. Both Bernoullis obtained the correct solution to this problem by
 applying the differential calculus of Leibniz, and they concluded that Newton's fail-

 ure demonstrated that he had not mastered the application of higher-order differentials

 in his fluxional calculus. They were unable, however, to find the source of Newton's

 error which later was pointed out by Lagrange (1797) who showed that Newton had

 treated incorrectly the third-order differentials that appeared in his approach.

 After frantically working on this problem, Newton was able to find the correct solu-

 tion by modifying the diagram that he had used in his original approach. Although
 the second edition of the Principia was already in the printer's hand, he managed
 to insert the revised solution, but he failed to acknowledge Bernoulli's contribution
 which offended the latter. Later on, this episode played a significant role in the pri-

 ority dispute that emerged between Newton and Leibniz on the discovery of the cal-

 culus, and Johann Bernoulli argued, anonymously, that the failure of Proposition 10,

 Book 2, demonstrated that at the time Newton wrote the first edition of the Principia he

 had not yet mastered the differential calculus. In a letter printed in the Acta Eruditorum

 for July 1716, Bernoulli wrote

 It is firmly established that Newton at the time he wrote his Principia Philos.

 Mathematica , still had not understood the method of differentiating differentials
 (Bernoulli 1716)

 It will be shown that there is some validity in Bernoulli's statement, and that even in

 the revised version of Proposition 10, Book 2, Newton continued to make errors in the

 1 For example, in Propositions 15-17, Book 2, Newton considered the effect of resistance on the motion
 of a body under the action of inverse square force (Brackenridge and Nauenberg 2002).

 2 For a detailed discussion of Newton's mathematical methods see (Guicciardini 2009).

 3 In a letter to Keill, "who was puzzled to know what Bernoulli was getting at" in his contention that
 Newton had not mastered the differential calculus, Newton wrote

 It appears thereby that I did not understand ye 2nd fluxions when I wrote that Scholium [i.e. to Prop-
 osition 10] because (as he thinks) I take the second terms of the series of the first fluxions, the third

 terms for the second fluxions & so on. But he [Bernoulli] is mightily mistaken when he thinks that
 I here make use of the method of fluxions. Tis only a branch of ye method of converging series
 that I there make uses of (Hall 1958, 296).

 application of third-order differentials, but fortuitously these errors did not prevent

 him from obtaining the correct solution to this proposition.

 In a section of his textbook Theorie des Fonctions Analytiques , Lagrange (1797)
 presented an analysis of Proposition 10, Book 2, applying Leibniz's differential cal-
 culus to describe the source of Newton's error. He concluded that

 We believe that it was not useless to show how the method of series is applied,

 and that it would be granted to us to shed light at the same time on a point of
 analysis on which the greatest geometers made mistakes, and which may be of

 interest to the history of the birth of the new calculus.4

 Newton's problems with Proposition 10, Book 2, illustrate some of the limitations of

 Newton's geometrical-fluxional method, and some of the advantages of the algorithmic
 approach of Leibniz.

 In Proposition 6, Book 1, Newton gave a mathematical description of the motion

 of a body under the influence of a central force. For a small but finite interval of time

 t, he postulated that the motion can be composed of an inertial or constant velocity

 contribution along the tangent of the orbit proportional to t and an accelerated motion

 along the instantaneous direction of the force proportional to t2. It is important to

 recognize, however, that in a series expansion in powers of f, Newton's composition

 is valid only up to quadratic terms in t. In Proposition 10, Book 2, Newton considered

 an additional force due to the resistance of the medium acting along the tangent of the

 orbit. In this case, the motion on a line element along tangent is not inertial leading to

 the complications in his treatment of this problem discussed here.

 In Sect. 2, Proposition 10, Book 2, is presented in the form given in the first edition

 of the Principia , and the source of Newton's error is described. In Sect. 3, the revised

 version of this proposition in the second edition of the Principia is discussed follow-

 ing closely Newton's verbal description of this proposition, but applying his fluxional
 calculus in a novel form that avoids his inconsistent treatment of cubic terms in his

 power expansions. In "Appendix I", the relation of Proposition 6, Book 1, to Propo-
 sition 10, Book 2, is presented, and following Lagrange's work (Lagrange 1797), in
 "Appendix II" Newton's missing term in cubic order in powers of the time interval t
 is derived.

 2 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the first edition of the Principia

 This section describes Newton's discussion of motion in a resisting medium under the
 action of a constant gravitational force given in Proposition 10, Book 2 of the first

 edition of the Principia , when the geometrical curve for the trajectory is given, and

 it explains why this description is flawed along the lines first discussed by Lagrange
 (1797).

 4 Nous avons cru qu'il n'etait pas inutile de faire voir comment la methode des series pouvait y conduire, et
 qu'on nous saurait gre d'eclaircir, en meme temps, un point d' analyse sul lequel les plus grands geometres'
 s'etoient trompes, etqui peut interreser l'histoire de la naissance des nouveaux calculs (Lagrange 1797,
 251).

 Referring to the curve AC K and tangent line hCH at C, Fig. 1, Newton started:

 let CH and Ch be equal rectilinear lengths which bodies moving away from

 place C would describe in these times [equal time intervals t ] without the action

 of the medium or gravity (Cohen 1999, 655).

 Without the action of the medium or gravity, a body moves with constant velocity, and

 therefore during an interval of time t

 CH = Ch = vt, (1)

 where v is the velocity along the tangent line at C. Newton continued:

 Through the resistance of the medium it comes about that the body as it moves

 forward describes instead of length CH, only length CF, and through the force

 of gravity the body is transferred from F to G, and thus line element HF and

 line element FG are generated simultaneously, the first by the force of resistance

 and the second by the force of gravity (Cohen 1999, 656).

 Let g be the acceleration of gravity, acting along the vertical direction, and r de-accel-

 eration due to the resistance of the medium acting along the tangent of the motion.
 Then, Newton asserted that

 HF = CH -CF = (1/2 )rt2, (2)
 FG = IG - I F = (1/2 )gt2, (3)

 and concluded

 And hence the resistance comes to be as HF directly and FG inversely, or as
 HF/FG .

 Indeed, according to the Eqs. 2 and 3

 HF/FG =r/g (4)

 x = -rx/v (5)

 y = -ry/v - 8 (6)

 Newton's decomposition of motion into a tangential and vertical component can
 be verified from the solution of the differential equations of motion in Cartesian coor-

 dinates jc, y to second order in the time interval t. We have

 where v = yjx 2 + y 2 is the velocity, r is the resistance,5 and g is the gravitational
 constant . Taking the origin at O, the Taylor series expansion of the solution of

 not relevant to his derivation.

 Eqs. 5 and 6 to second order in t is

 and

 y = BC-{vt- (1/2 )rf2) sin(a) - ('/2)gt2 (8)

 where v is the velocity at C, and tan(a) = - y/x. The angle a gives the incli-
 nation of the tangent line at C relative to the horizontal, i.e. tan(a) = I F/CI.
 These two relations demonstrate the validity, to second order in the time interval t , of

 Newton's decomposition of the motion along the arc CG, namely, a component along

 the tangential line

 CF - vt - ( '/2)rt 2, (9)

 where CH = vt, and another vertical component

 FG = (1/2 )gt2, (10)

 These two relations, however, cannot be applied to determine the ratio r/g from

 Newton's relation, Eq. 4, because although the line element FG is determined by the
 geometry of the curve AGK, this is not the case for the line element HF. Therefore,

 Newton proceeded to obtain a second expression for r/g. But it will be shown that the

 resulting expression is not valid because it depended on quantities that are of cubic
 order in t that could not be calculated from Newton's geometrical construction.

 For this purpose, Newton considered the time-reversed motion in which case the

 medium accelerates the body along the tangent. Taking a segment Ck of the line
 element Cf to be equal to CF,

 Ck = vt' + (1/2 )rta = vt- (1/2 )rt2 (1 1)

 where tf is the time interval to traverse the line element Ck in the absence of gravity.
 Hence, to second order in powers of t.

 t' -t = -(r/v)t2, (12)

 and the vertical line element kl is then

 It follows that

 kl = (1/2 )gt'2. (13)

 FG - kl & g(t - t')t = ( gr/v)t 3. (14)

 Fig. 1 Newton's diagram for Prop. 10, Book 2 in the first edition of the Principia

 It is clear, however, that this relation cannot be valid, because Newton had determined

 the line elements FG , Eq. 10, and /:/, Eq. 13, only up to second order in t , while the
 difference between these line elements is found to be third order in t. Unaware of this

 difficulty, Newton applied this relation to obtain an alternate expression that depends

 on the resistance r, and in Corollary 2 to Proposition 10, he obtained result

 r/g = (FG - kl)C F/4FG2 (15)

 which follows from Eq. 14 by substituting for v, the approximation v & CF/t, Eq. 9,

 and for f , t = V 2FG/g , Eq. 10. In this form, Newton's relation for r depends on line

 elements that can be determined purely from the geometry of curve.

 Referring to his diagram, Fig. 1, Newton expressed these line elements by a series
 expansion in powers of the space interval o = BD = Bi, up to cubic powers in o.
 Setting P = BC , the ordinate DG is

 DG = P - Qo- Ro2 - So3, (16)

 where Q, R and S are coefficients with values at the abscissa O D that are determined6
 by the given curve ALGK , Fig. 1. Since

 DF = P-Qo , (17)

 FG = DF - DG = Ro2 + S03. (18)

 6 In Cartesian coordinate x = OD, y = DG, and according to the Taylor series expansion, in Leibniz's
 notation P = - d^/dx, R = - ( 1 /2!)d2jy/djc2, and S = - (l/3!)d3;y/djt3. At least 24 years earlier, how-
 ever, in Corollary 3 of the revised De Quadratura (1691), Newton already had obtained these relations
 for the coefficient of a power series expansion, expressed in his dot notation for higher-order fluxions,
 e.g y = dy/djt, y = d2y/djc2, etc. (Whiteside 1976). I thank N. Guicciardini for this reference.

 Finally, substituting in Newton's relation, Eq. 15, CF = o^J 1 + Q2 and FG2 = /?2o4,
 one obtains

 r/g = (S/2R2)Vl + Q2. (23)

 For the first application of this relation, Newton consider the case that the given

 curve AC K, Fig. 1 , is a semicircle of radius n. Introducing the symbol a for the abscissa

 and e for the ordinate of this curve, he obtained y/' + Q2 = n/e, R = n2 / 2e3, and
 S = an2 / 2e3, which

 r/g = a/n. (24)

 Since the tangential component of gravity is ga/n , Newton's result implied that the

 total tangential acceleration r-ga/n vanishes. Hence, the velocity must be a constant ,

 but he found, on the other hand, that the velocity varied with the square root of the
 ordinate of the semicircle:

 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the Principia , revisited 573

 Likewise, the ordinate il is

 il = p + Q0 - Ro2 + So 3, (19)

 and

 Hence

 and

 ik = P + Qo. (20)

 kl = ik - il = Ro 2 - So 3, (21)

 FG -kl = 25o3. (22)

 departing from C along the straight line CF, could subsequently move in a
 parabola having diameter CB and latus rectum (1 + Q2)/R . . . (Cohen 1999,
 660)

 For parabolic motion, the velocity v is given by v2 = ga /2, where a is the latus
 rectum, and therefore v = y/ (g/2R)(' + Q2) which implies in this case that

 v = (25)

 This relation for the velocity turns out to be correct, but it contradicts Newton's previ-

 ous result, Eq. 24, that the acceleration due to gravity along a circular path is exactly
 compensated by the de-acceleration due to the resistance of the medium. Evidently
 this contradiction escaped Newton's attention, but it was noticed by Johann Bernoulli
 when he read Proposition 10, Book 2.

 574 M. Nauenberg

 In Theorem VI of his paper in the Memoires of 171 1 and the Acta Eruditorum of

 1713, Johann Bernoulli wrote, Hall (1958)

 In order that a body moving in a resisting medium may describe a circle LCK ,

 on the supposition hat a uniform gravity tends directly towards the horizontal, I

 say that the resistance in each point C will be to the gravity as 30 G to 20 K

 Here OA' is the radius n of the circle, and OG is the abscissa a in Newton's nota-

 tion. Hence Bernoulli's correct result7 for the ratio of resistance to gravity, r/g =

 (3/2 )OG/ OK, differs from Newton's, Eq. 24, by a factor 3/2.

 Newton' analysis is flawed because the difference in the Galilean time intervals t

 and tf to fall under the action of gravity along the line elements FG and kl , respec-

 tively, depends on the third power of t , but he could calculated these line elements

 only up to second power of t. Applying the differential equations of motion, Eq. 5 and

 6 to obtain the power series expansion of x, ^ to cubic order in t , first carried out by
 Lagrange (1797), yields (see "Appendix II")

 FG = (1/2 )gt2 - (l/6)(rg/v)f3. (26)

 Correspondingly

 kl = (1/2 )gt'2 + (1/6 ){rg/v)t' (27)

 which together with Eq. 12, now gives the correct value

 FG-kl = (2/3)(gr/v)t' (28)

 valid to third order in t. Hence, instead of Newton's relation for r/g , Eq. 15, we have

 r/g = (3/2 )(FG - kl)C F/4FG2 (29)

 and substituting FG - kl = 2 So3, Eq. 22, C F = oj 1 + Q2 and FG2 = R2o4 yields
 the correct value8

 r/g = (3S/4/?Vl + Q2. (30)

 7 In a scholium following his theorem, Bernoulli criticized Newton's result as follows:

 Lest any one who is unable to examine these matters more deeply should wonder whether perhaps we
 were mistaken in confuting what has been disclosed with so much labour by this most acute man, I
 will demonstrate here that this Newtonian ratio leads to a contradiction. For if the resistance be to the

 gravity as OG to OAT as Newton has it, then since the gravity itself is to the tangential force as OC or
 OK lo OG, equally the resistance would be to the tangential or motive force as OG to OG, therefore
 the resistance will be equal to the motive force, and the velocity at any point C uniform, whereas we
 previously showed it to be VCG, and consequently non-uniform, as Newton himself agrees (Hall 1 958).

 8 Johann Bernoulli suggested that Newton obtained the wrong result for the ratio r/g , 23, because he had
 erroneously assumed that R = - d2y/djt2, and S = - d3y/cbr (Whiteside 1981). But Bernoulli's sugges-
 tion is incorrect, and it is a coincidence that replacing in Eq. 23, 2 R for R, and 65 for 5, yields the missing

 factor 3/2.

 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the Principia , revisited 575

 Newton, however, could not have obtained this result, which differs from his result

 by an extra factor 3 /2, because it required the expansion of line elements to third order
 in the time interval t. But he could not have calculated the coefficient of this term from

 his geometrical - fluxional approach, which was confined to the second order in t.

 After obtaining his first relation for r/g, Eq. 4, Newton warned the reader that

 This is so in the case of nascent line elements. For in the case of line elements

 of finite magnitude these ratios are not accurate (Cohen 1999, 656).

 But then he proceeded to ignore his own warning, and derived a second relation for

 r/g , Eq. 23, that is incorrect and leads to a result for r/g that misses a factor 3/2.

 3 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the second and third edition of the Principia

 After receiving Niklaus Bernoulli warning from his uncle Johann Bernoulli that his

 result in Proposition 10 in Book 2 for motion in a medium under the action of gravity

 led to an inconsistent result for circular motion, Newton approached the problem in a

 different manner which he managed to insert, in the last moment, in the second edition

 of the Principia. He abandoned his previous approach based on time-reversed motion,

 and instead, he now determined the required differential changes in line elements and

 arcs at two adjacent points on a given curve describing the motion of a body moving
 only forward in time. He described his new diagram, Fig. 2, as follows:

 Let P Q be the plane of the horizon perpendicular to the plane of the figure;
 PFHQ a curved line meeting this plane in points P and G; G, //, /, and k four
 places of the body as it goes in the curve from F to Q' and GB , //C, ID and
 K E four parallel ordinates dropped from these points to the horizon and stand-
 ing upon the horizontal line PQ at points B,C, D, and E' and let BC, CD and
 DE be distances between the ordinates equal to one another. From the points G
 and H draw the straight lines GL and HN touching the curve at G and H and

 meeting at L and N the ordinates CH and Dl produced upwards and complete
 the parallelogram HCDM (Cohen 1999, 655).

 Newton proceeded again to describe analytically the arcs and the line elements

 associated with the curve in his new diagram by expanding locally the ordinates, sep-

 arated equally by a small distance o , in a power series up to cubic order in o. But he
 continued to assert, as before, that the different time intervals associated with these

 space intervals are proportional to the square root of the deviations from tangential

 motion due to gravity, although this proportionality is correct only to first order in o.

 Then the times [ T , t ] in which the body describes arcs GH and HI will be as
 the square roots of the distances LH and N I which the body would describe in

 those times by falling from the tangents (Cohen 1999, 656).

 The "distances" LH and N I replaced the analogous line elements FG and kl in his

 previous diagram, Fig. 1, but again Newton set these line elements proportional to the
 square of the time intervals t and T, although his expansion of these line elements
 in powers of the space interval o required also cubic terms. Moreover, Newton also
 assumed that these distances were proportional to the corresponding sagittas associ-

 ated with the description of this curve, that he evaluated to cubic order in o. But this

 equivalence9 is valid only up to second order in o.

 Therefore, the question arises why, in spite of requiring the expansion of line ele-

 ments to cubic powers in o , Newton nevertheless succeed in obtained the correct

 expression for the resistance of the medium. It will be shown that the answer to this

 question is that Newton's geometrical descriptions can be implemented by restricting

 the calculation of line elements to power series expansions up to second order in o ,

 and that Newton's application of cubic terms in o , erroneously linked in this order to

 his time intervals t and T , fortuitously, did not affect his calculations.

 Referring to his diagram, Fig. 2, Newton explained that

 the velocities will be directly as G H and H I and inversely as the times. Represent

 the times by T and t , and the velocities by GH/ T and HI /t, and the decrement

 of the velocity occurring in time t will be represented by GH /T - HI /t (Cohen
 1999, 656).

 The ratios GH/T and HI /t, however, are the mean velocities over the arcs GH and
 HI , while for his calculation, Newton required only the instantaneous velocities at
 G and H. These velocities are given by the ratios GL/T and HN/t , respectively.
 Expanding the ordinate D I in a power series to cubic order in o

 DI = P - Qo- Ro2 - So3, (31)

 9 For motion under the action of a central force, Newton described in Proposition 1 , Book 1 of the Principia

 the deviation from inertial motion by the sagitta of small arcs of a curve that can be associated with this
 proposition, while in Proposition 6, Book 1, the corresponding deviation was described by a small line
 element from the tangent to the orbit. But these two deviations are equal, only to second order in a series

 expansion in powers of the differential time interval associated with these two deviations.

 where P = CH, and the coefficients Q , /? and 5 define the nature of the curve at H ,

 WW = oVl + e2, (32)

 and

 N/ = /?o2 + So3. (33)

 Up to first order in o , we have

 r = yJ(l/g)NI = oJ(2R/g), (34)

 where g is the constant of gravity, and the velocity at H is10

 f = HN/t = J(g/2R)(l + Q2). (35)

 Newton obtained this result which he phrased as follows:

 And the velocity is that with which a body going forth from any place H along

 the tangent HN can then move in a vacuum in a parabola having a diameter11
 HC and a latus rectum HN2/NI or (1 + Q2/R) ( Cohen 1999, 658).

 Likewise, the velocity at the adjacent point G is

 V' = GL/T = y/(g/2R')(l + Q'2) (36)

 where, to first order in o, the coefficients Q' and R' are

 Q' = Q- 2 Ro, (37)
 R' = R- 3 So, (38)

 Newton wrote:

 and the decrement of the velocity occurring in time t will be represented by
 GH/T - Hl/t (Cohen 1999, 657).

 10 Newton had shown that the square of the velocity satisfies the relation v2/p = gn , where p is the
 radius of curvature at //, and gn is the component of gravity normal to the tangent (Proposition 6,
 Corollary 3). Moreover, he had obtained the general mathematical expression for p in Cartesian coor-
 dinates , p = (1 4- 02)3/2/2/?, and gn - g cos(a), where a is the angle of the tangent line HN with the

 abscissa, i.e. cos(a) = '/y/' + Q 2. These relations lead to an alternative derivation of Eq. 35.

 1 1 The latus rectum for parabolic motion in a vacuum under the action of gravity is 2i >2/g, and setting its
 value equal to (1 + Q2)/R leads to Eq. 35. But the diameter of this parabola is not HC , but is directed,
 instead, along the line from H perpendicular to the tangent line HN.

 Actually, this decrement of the velocity can be obtained more readily by replacing the
 arcs GH and HI by the tangent lines GL and HN , respectively.12 Hence, applying
 Eqs. 35, 36, 37 and 38, one obtains.13

 v'-v = oj2iR [-C/V( 1 + Q 2) + (3S/4/?V(l + Q2)' ■ (39)

 where v' - v = GL/T - HN/t

 This is an example of the "the method of differentiating differentials", which

 Johann Bernoulli later asserted, that Newton had not understood. Instead, Newton
 continued as follows:

 This decrement arises from the resistance retarding the body and from the grav-

 ity accelerating the body ... but in a body describing arc HI, gravity increases
 the arc by only the length HI - HN or MI x N I /HI, and thus generates only
 the velocity 2 MI x Nl/t x HI , ( Cohen 1999, 657).

 MI /HI % MN/HN = Q/J' + Q2, (40)

 Substituting

 and

 NI/t=OyfjRi2 (41)

 one obtains, to first order in o ,

 2 MI x Nl/t x HI = (<2/V(l + Q2)) , (42)

 which corresponds to the first term on the right hand side of Eq. 39.

 Add this velocity to the above decrement and the result is the decrement of the
 velocity arising from the resistance alone namely GH/T - HI /t + 2 MI x
 NI/(t x HI), (Cohen 1999, 657).

 12 To obtain his results, Newton had to determine the arcs HI and GH to second order in o: HI =
 oy/' + Q2 - QRo2jy/' 4- Q2, and GH - oy/ 1 + Q 2 + QRo2/y/' + Q2. But the difference between

 these arc lengths GH - HI = 2QRo2/y/' + Q 2 is equal to the difference between the tangent lines

 GL - HN , where HN = OyJ 1 + Q2, Eq. 32, and GL = Oy/' 4- Q '2, with Q' = Q - 2 Ro, Eq. 37.

 13 This geometrical relation can be verified by applying the equations of motion in differential form,
 Eqs. 5 and 6. We have xx + y'y - vv = -rv - gy/v , and substituting y = usin(a), one obtains
 v = - r + gsin(a), the total acceleration along the tangent. In Eq. 39, v = (v - v')/t , t = o*/2R/g ,

 Eq. 34, and sin(a) = Q/{ 1 + Q 2). Hence r = g(3S/4R2)>J' + Q2, which is Newton's result for the
 resistance of the medium in terms of the coefficients Q, R and S that determine the local properties of the

 given curve.

 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the Principia, revisited 579

 Hence, this decrement of the velocity "arising from the resistance alone" is the second

 term on the right hand side of Eq. 39, and

 GL/T - HN/t + 2 MN x Nl/(t x HN) = oJg/2R [(35/2/?)>/(l + <22)] •

 (43)

 And accordingly since gravity generates the velocity 2N I /t in the same time in
 afallen body, the resistance will be to the gravity as GH xt/T - HI +2MI x
 NI/HI to 2NI (Cohen 1999, 657).

 The velocity generated by gravity in a fallen body is

 gt = 2NI/t = oj2^R, (44)

 and dividing Eq. 43 by this velocity yields Newton's relation for the ratio r/g of the

 resistance r of the medium to the acceleration g of gravity

 r/g = (3S/4/?2) Vl + e2 (45)

 where r/g = (GL x t/T - HN)/2NI + MN/HN.

 Newton, however, proceeded in a different manner to evaluate the ratio r/g by

 expressing analytically his geometrical line elements in a power series expansion up
 to cubic powers in o. But his relations for the time intervals T and t in term of the
 line elements LH and N I , e.g. Eq. 34, are only valid to first order in o. Moreover,

 Newton calculated these time intervals from the corresponding sagittas of the arcs Gl

 and H K which in third order in o differ from the expansion of the line elements LH
 and NI. He stated,

 Furthermore, if from ordinate CH half the sum of ordinates BG and Dl are
 subtracted and from ordinate Dl half the sum of ordinates CH and EK are

 subtracted, the remainder will be sagittas Ro 2 and Ro 2 + 3 So3 of arcs Gl and
 HK. And these are proportional to the line elements LH and N I , and thus as
 the square of the infinitesimal small time T and t (Cohen 1999, 658).

 But to third order in o

 and

 LH = Ro2- 2 So3 (46)

 NI = Ro2 + 5o3 (47)

 which, contrary to Newton's assertion, are not proportional to the corresponding
 sagittas when the expansion is carried out to the cubic order in o. This discrepancy
 raises the concern that, like in his earlier version of Proposition 10, Book 2, Newton's

 would have obtained incorrectly cubic terms in the expansion of T2 and t2 in power

 of o. But it turns out that the quantity required for Newton's new calculation for r/g,

 Eq. 45, requires only the ratio T / 1 up to first order in o which is proportional to the

 square root of ratio between the line elements NI/LH. And to first order in o , this

 ratio is also equal to the ratio between the corresponding sagittas, namely14

 T/t = y/NI/LH = 1 - (3/2 )So. (48)

 4 Concluding remarks

 In a private memorandum, written on 7 June 1713, Newton accounted for the mistake

 in the first version of Proposition 10, Book 2 as follows:

 Mr. Newton corrected the error himself, shewed him [Nickolas Bernoulli] the

 correction & told him that the Proposition should be reprinted in the new Edi-
 tion which was then coming abroad. The Tangents [GL and HN] of the Arcs
 GH and HI are first moments of the arcs FG & GH [that] should have been

 drawn the same way with the motion describing those arcs, whereas through

 inadvertency [my italics] one of them had been drawn the contrary way, & this
 occasioned the error in the conclusion (Hall 1958)

 Actually, it has been shown here that in this memorandum, Newton gave a misleading

 account of the origin of his error in the first version of this proposition. There was

 nothing "inadvertent" in his drawing a tangent line, labelled Cf in the first edition
 of the Principia , Fig. 1, in the "contrary way" to the tangent line CF, because his

 drawing, introduced specifically to solve his proposition, described the time-reversed
 motion at C. Evidently, at the time Newton failed to realize that a solution by his
 geometrical calculus approach required that the power series expansion associated

 with the trajectory curve had to be taken to cubic order in the time interval. But the

 fundamental principles of orbital motion under the action of external forces that he
 had enunciated in Propositions 1 and 6, Book 1, were based on such expansions only

 up to second order in differential time and spatial intervals. After obtaining his first

 relation for the ratio of resistance to gravity, r/g , Eq. 4, Newton warned the reader
 that

 This is so in the case of nascent line elements. For in the case of line elements

 of finite magnitude these ratios are not accurate (Cohen 1999, 656).

 But then he proceeded to ignore his own warning to derive a relation for r/g , Eq. 23,

 that is incorrect by a factor 3/2. In the revised version of Proposition 10, Book 2, he

 also applied power series expansions to cubic order in the space interval o , but as has

 been shown here, in this case only expansions to second order in o are required, which

 explains why, somewhat fortuitously, he obtained the missing factor 3/2.

 14 A simple way to see how this relation saved Newton from repeating his previous error is to suppose that
 t2 = Ro + C(? where C is an undetermined coefficient. Then the expansion of T 2 must be calculated
 with the corresponding value Rr = R - 3 So, while the change in C gives a fourth order change in 7 2 that
 can be neglected. Hence T/t = 1 - QS/2R)o , Eq. 48, independent of the value of C that Newton evaluated

 incorrectly.

 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the Principia, revisited 581

 During the bitter priority dispute with Leibniz on the invention of the calculus,
 Newton called attention to Proposition 10, Book 2, to exhibit an example of an
 early application of his fluxion version of the calculus to solve problems solution
 Principia. But this proposition was a poor choice, because he had made a "seri-
 ous error" in it, and after he corrected his mistake, he failed to acknowledge Johann
 Bernoulli's contribution, who was bitter and became, albeit anonymously, his most
 effective critic.

 Appendix I: Relation of Proposition 10, Book 2, to Proposition 6, Book 1

 In Proposition 6, Book 1 in the Principia Newton gave a geometrical expression for
 the acceleration of a body moving under the action of a central force in terms of a line
 element, QR , directed towards the centre of force, that describes the deviation from

 inertial motion along a line element PR , tangent at P, Fig. 3. The magnitude of PR
 is proportional to the elapse time interval t , and the deviation QR is proportional t 2,
 in accordance with Lemma 10, Book 1. Moreover, in Proposition 1, Book 1, Newton

 had shown that for central forces t is proportional to the area element SP x QT swept

 by the radial line SP , leading to the geometrical expression for the force or acceler-
 ation, QT /{SP x QT)2. Such a description, however, not valid in the presence of
 non-central Newton was able to generalize his description for non-central forces, but

 in the presence of a tangential force however, such a description is incomplete, because

 the resulting acceleration is directed along the instantaneous direction of motion. In
 the original version of the Proposition 10, Book 2, the line elements FG and CF,
 Fig. 1, are the analogs of QR and PR, respectively, while in the revised version in

 the second edition of the Principia , the corresponding line elements are N I and H N .

 Newton continued to assert that the line elements FG and NI are proportional to t 2,
 and to take into account the resistance of the medium, Newton had to assume that the

 motion along the tangent was the sum of an inertial component proportion to t and
 a component proportional to t2. But the resulting geometrical relations were incom-

 plete and Newton searched for additional conditions that would enable him to obtain a

 geometrical relation for the motion. In the first edition of the Principia , he obtained an

 additional constraint by considering the time-reversed motion starting from the same

 initial point. In this case, the medium accelerates the motion along the tangent, but
 unfortunately, his application of Lemma 10 for this problem was insufficient, because

 as Lagrange, later demonstrated, a contribution to the lime element of cubic powers
 of t is required for a correct solution of this problem. Newton's neglect of this con-
 tribution led him to an incorrect solution which was noticed by Johann Bernoulli and
 pointed out by his nephew, Nikolaus Bernoulli to Newton. Newton's evaluation for
 the instantaneous velocity at //, v = y/(g/2R)( 1 + Q2), Eq. 62, corresponds to the
 relation gn = v2 / p, where gn = g cos(a) is the component of gravity normal to the

 tangent, and p = (1 + Q2)3^2 /R is the curvature at H. In Corollary 3 of Proposition 6,
 Book 1, this relation was given in a related form g = I2 /SY2 x PV for a central force

 g, where P V = 2p cos(a) and / = SP v cos(a) are the angular momentum about the
 centre of force.

 Appendix II: Lagrange's analysis of Proposition 10, Book 2

 Lagrange was the first mathematician to obtain the correct explanation for Newton's

 failure to obtain the correct relation for motion in a resistive medium (Lagrange 1797).

 Lagrange' s analysis did not deal directly with Newton's geometrical approach, but a

 similar analysis is presented here evaluating Newton's line element N I in Proposition
 10, Book 2, to cubic order in the time interval t.

 The equations of motion for this problem in differential form are

 x = -r cos(a) (49)

 y = r sin (a) - g, (50)

 d3y/dt3 = r cos(a)6? + sin(a)r, (52)

 where a = da /d t, and r = dr/dt.

 Expanding Newton's line elements in powers of a small interval t up to cubic order,

 HM = x = i;cos(a)f - (l/2)r cos(a)f2 + (1/6 )(r sin(a)d - cos(a)r)f3, (53)

 MI=HC - y=v sin(a)t - (l/2)(r sin(a) - g)t 2 - (l/6)(r cos(a)dr+ sin(a)r)f3.

 where x = d2jt/d f2, y - d2;y/df2, andtan(a) = -dy/dx. For the power series expan-
 sion, we require also the third-order derivative

 d3x/dt 3 = r sin(a)d - cos(a)r, (51)

 Proposition 10, Book 2, in the Principia, revisited 583

 Since MN = HM tan(a),

 and NI = MI - MN

 MN = i;sin(o ',)t - (l/2)r sin(a)f2 + (l/6)(r sin(a) tan(a)d - sin(a)r)f3, (55)

 NI = (1/2 )gt2 - (l/6)(r/cos(a))d)?3, (56)

 which is independent of r. We have

 dtan(a)d t = (l/cos2(a))d = ( yx - xy)/x2 = g/x (57)

 which yields

 a = ( g/v ) cos(of) (58)

 Hence, to cubic order in t]5

 NI = {'l2)gt2 -('mrg/v)t' (59)

 Appendix III: Proposition 10, Book 2, expressed in terms of differential
 equations, and Johann Bernoulli's solution

 tional force g is treated by expressing the equations of motion in differential form. In

 where r is the resistance, and v is the velocity

 and

 Hence

 v = yjx2 + y2. (62)

 15 Following Lagrange, this result was also obtained by Whiteside; see footnote (6) in (Whiteside 1981,
 375).

 To obtain an expression for this ratio in terms of the geometrical curve for the

 trajectory, the time must be replaced by x as an independent variable. Since

 r/g = -(v/g + y/v) (64)

 y = y'x (65)

 and

 y = y'x + y"x2 (66)

 In particular, ra/gx = 3/2 is the constant ratio of frictional force to the tangential

 gravitational force, which accounts for the decrease in velocity as y decreases.

 In the first edition of the Principia , the factor 3/2 was absent, and Johann Bernoulli

 observed that in this case, the resistance force was equal to the gravitational acceler-

 ation along the curve, indicating that the velocity should be a constant - "la vitesse
 de ce mobile seroit ici toujours la mesme & uniforme" - along the curve, leading
 to an inconsistency in Newton's result - "Ce que est la contradiction que j'avois a
 demontrer"16

 Johann Bernoulli treated the motion in a resisting medium somewhat differently,

 by separating the differential equations of motion into its tangential and normal com-

 ponents. He considered only the special case of circular motion, but I will treat also
 the motion along a general curve.

 Acknowledgments I would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of Derek (Tom) Whiteside, whom

 I had the privilege to know and benefit from his numerous criticisms of my earlier work. Tom devoted over

 hundred pages of his last volume of Newton 's Mathematical Papers to describe the manuscripts in which
 Newton made frantic efforts to correct the initial errors he had made in Proposition 1 0, Book 2. Recently,

 he warned against creating "monsters" when framing Newton's ideas in vector form, "which felled even
 the mighty Lagrange in his attempt wholly to understand it" (Whiteside 2002), but such monsters are still
 being created up to the present time. I also would like to thank Niccolo Guicciardini for bringing to my
 attention the controversies associated with Newton's formulation of Proposition 10, Book 2, and for an

 uncountable number of exchanges that helped to clarify my ideas on this subject, and to Gary Weisel for

 calling my attention to Whiteside's above apropos comment.
