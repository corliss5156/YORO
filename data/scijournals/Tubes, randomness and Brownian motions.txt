 Abstract In this paper, we examine the pioneering research on electronic noise -
 the current fluctuations in electronic circuit devices due to their intrinsic physical

 characteristics rather than their defects - in Germany and the U.S. during the 1910s-

 1920s. Such research was not just another demonstration of the general randomness
 of the physical world Einstein's work on Brownian motion had revealed. In contrast,

 we stress the importance of a particular engineering context to electronic noise studies:

 the motivation to design and improve high-gain thermionic-tube amplifiers for radio

 and wired communications. Engineering scientists' endeavors to understand electronic

 noise started in 1918, when Walter Schottky at Siemens formulated a theory of "shot

 noise," current fluctuations owing to the random emissions of discrete electrons in a
 tube. Schottky's theory was revised and experimentally tested at Siemens, General

 Electric, and AT&T during the 1920s, leading to the discoveries of several other types

 of noise and an increasing interest in the thermal fluctuations in electronic circuits.
 In 1925-1928, J.B. Johnson and Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs developed a theory of
 thermal noise for any electrical resistor at a non-zero temperature. Although these

 studies were initiated to chart the fundamental performance limit of electronic tech-

 nology, they ended up assisting the empirical determination of individual electronic
 components' characteristics.

 1 Introduction

 Very few scientific works at the turn of the twentieth century were as significant as the

 study of Brownian motion. In both popular and scholarly literatures, Einstein's 1905
 paper (and Marian Smoluchowski's independent article a year later) on this subject

 provided a novel rationale for the existence of atoms, leading to Jean Perrin's provision

 of experimental evidence for such otherwise conjectural objects. It marked as well the
 onset of a statistical mechanics that focused on unstable phenomena and sought pro-

 grammatically to compute the macroscopic effects of microscopic characteristics. And

 it laid the foundation for the mathematics of stochastic processes that would come to

 play a crucial part in realms ranging from pricing financial commodities and designing

 gun-control systems to modeling biological evolution and predicting climate change.1

 Despite the extensive literature on the history of Brownian motion, one of its impor-

 tant implications has rarely been addressed: the understanding and effects of electronic
 noise. Brownian motion, after all, was not only about the esoteric behavior of pollen

 dusts under a microscope, or even solely about the reformulation of statistical mechan-

 ics, the provision of evidence for atomism, or the production of new mathematical
 methods. It had increasingly salient implications as well for the practical world of
 telecommunications. As thermionic tubes became more and more indispensable to
 high-fidelity cabled telephone and radio systems, engineers endeavored to improve
 the performance of such electronic devices and to explore the ultimate limit of their
 performance. In the 1910s-1930s, researchers in Germany and the U.S. investigated
 the Brownian-like fluctuations of microscopic charge carriers in electronic tubes and

 associated circuit components in efforts to understand and to quantify the disturbances
 such fluctuations produced in the transmission of voice signals, whose frequencies

 ranged from several hertz to tens of kilohertz. "Schottky" (shot) noise and "Johnson"

 (thermal) noise were the best known products of these efforts.

 Gtinter Dorfel and Dieter Hoffmann's work is the only detailed historical study
 of electronic noise. They examined the theoretical reasoning and experimental find-
 ings that led to the formulation of Schottky and Johnson noise, and situated such

 studies in the context of attempts to come to grips with the fundamental limit of mea-
 surement.2 According to Dorfel and Hoffmann, some physicists in the 1900s- 1920s
 considered electronic noise to be intrinsic fluctuations of electrical currents, similar

 in their view to the Brownian motion of pollen dust. From Einstein's schematic elec-

 trostatic electrometer for the amplification of fluctuating electricity and Geertruida
 de Haas-Lorentz's analysis of the effect of thermal agitation on metrology to Frits
 Zernike's and Gustav Ising's examinations of galvanometer's sensitivity, electronic
 noise seemed to impose an ultimate constraint on the accuracy of any electrical mea-
 suring devices. The thermal agitations of galvanometers, electrometers, or any other
 measuring devices at non-zero temperature unavoidably reduced their sensitivity and
 thus restricted the minimum level of signals they could measure. Before the introduc-

 tion of the uncertainty principle and the notion of quantum indeterminancy, Brownian

 noise was widely conceived of as the fundamental barrier to the exactness of measure-
 ment.3

 Electronic noise indeed posed challenges in the early twentieth century as sci-

 entists attempted to grapple with its implications for their ways of handling issues
 concerning accuracy and precision. Although the discussions concerning these chal-
 lenges constituted an important aspect of noise research during this period, another
 equally significant aspect was the specific engineering context within which such
 research proceeded. The discoveries of and early research on electronic noise were
 done at industrial laboratories - Siemens's "K Laboratory," AT&T Bell Laboratories,

 and General Electric's Schenectady Laboratory. And the purpose of these endeavors

 was to improve the quality of the thermionic tubes and associated electronic circuits

 that were just becoming prevalent in radio and long-range telephonic systems. After the
 invention of feedback amplifiers in the 1910s, vacuum tube circuits were designed to

 facilitate significant amplification of minute electrical signals with minor distortion.4
 As weaker and weaker signals could thereby be detected, the previously inconsequen-

 tial "background noise" became an increasing nuisance, and hence demanded a closer
 examination. In consequence, the studies of shot noise and thermal noise in the 1910s-
 1930s concerned either the characteristics of thermionic tubes or the functionality of

 other electrical devices in tube circuits. And here we find that the engineering scientists

 were not concerned to single out one noise-producing factor over another as worthy of

 particular understanding from a fundamental standpoint. To them, no particular noise
 source was in and of itself considered to be any more "fundamental" than a plethora

 of other sources of uncertainties that might corrupt signals, for that was their sole
 concern - the alleviation of disturbances that corrupted signal transmission. And so,

 in that context, the intrinsically stochastic character of Brownian motion was just one

 factor - albeit an important one - among the several that generated electronic noise.

 Other, system-dependent factors, such as the aggregation of electric charge at different

 degrees of vacuum in thermionic tubes also played significant roles, especially in the
 case of shot noise.

 This article explores precisely that engineering context in the origin of electronic
 noise research. Like Dorfel and Hoffmann, we will also examine Schottky's, Johnson's,

 and Nyquist's works (albeit at a finer scale). In contrast with these authors, however,
 we will also pay close attention to the experimental and technological developments

 that revealed the particularity of electronic noise. In Section 2, we examine the German

 physicist Walter Schottky's intellectual route to the theory of the "Schroteffekt," or
 shot noise. Section 3 gives analyses of the aftermath of Schottky's theory, including

 empirical testing of the theory and the discovery of a new kind of noise, the flicker
 effect, as researchers tried to identify the physical conditions that produced shot noise.
 Section 4 concerns American scientists John B. Johnson and Harry Nyquist's work at

 the AT&T Bell Labs, work that led to the claim concerning the inevitability of thermal

 noise in every electrical resistor at a non-zero temperature. Section 5 turns briefly to

 the general engineering treatment of noise by the 1930s.5

 2 Walter Schottky's route to the "Schroteffekt"

 Engineers had known about electrical circuits' fluctuating performance for some time.

 Their hardware was never perfect enough. The tube amplifier, a still immature tech-

 nology in the 1910s, was especially problematic. Fluctuating battery output disturbed
 a tube's bias voltage. Variations of the filament temperature affected an electronic
 current's uniformity. A tube wall's bad insulation created charge leakage. Casual
 design of supporting containers caused unexpected mechanical coupling and reso-
 nance. These factors were not essentially different from the ways in which defective
 devices degraded engineering products. Yet did the defective-device factors exhaust

 performance uncertainty? Or did tube amplifiers have a fundamental performance

 limit determined by the basic nature of electrons, not by malfunctions of design and

 manufacturing? The German physicist Walter Schottky was one of the first to ask these
 questions.

 2.1 Schottky's intellectual background

 Son of German mathematician Friedrich Hermann Schottky, Walter Hans was born

 in Zurich, Switzerland, and moved to Berlin when his father was appointed professor

 at the Friedrich- Wilhelm University (the University of Berlin). Walter studied phys-

 ics, took courses with Max Planck and Walter Nernst, and chose Planck to supervise
 his Ph.D. thesis. His research was on the dynamics of the electron near the relativistic

 limit, which was consistent with Planck's general interest to reconcile electrodynamics
 with special relativity. He defended his thesis in 19 12.6

 After receiving his Ph.D., Schottky was tired of theory and switched to experimen-

 tal physics "as remedy for pure abstraction." He moved to Jena for postgraduate study
 with Max Wien, who was experimenting on electrons. Schottky's first task as Wien's
 assistant was to measure electrical currents on light-illuminated metal surfaces. In
 1877, when Heinrich Hertz was experimenting with the spark gaps that would lead
 to the famous discovery of electromagnetic waves, he found that the intensity of the
 induced spark at the gap of the receiving coil changed with the light influx on the
 coil. Dubbed as the photoelectric effect, this phenomenon was closely studied in

 the following decade. By the turn of the century, it was widely believed that the photo-

 electric effect occurred when light drove the electrons in a piece of metal into motions,

 which provided sufficient energy for the electrons to escape from the metal and con-

 sequently created an electric current in the space surrounding the metal. An important
 empirical law from this study was so-called Stoletov's law (h la the Russian physicist

 5 Dorfel and Hoffmann examined Schottky's, Johnson's, and Nyquist's works, which we will also do,
 albeit with further detail. Our primary aim is however to focus on related experimental and technological
 developments concerning the nature of electronic noise.

 Aleksandr Stoletov) that the strength of the photoelectric current was proportional to

 the intensity of the illuminating light.7

 Schottky's experimental work with Wien contradicted the Stoletov's law, however:

 the measured current remained weak regardless of the illuminating light intensity,
 which should not have been the case. This result implied that the metal's electrons

 were prevented from leaving the metal surface to the air, and he conjectured that the

 space charge, the electric charge in air (induced by the emitted electrons) surrounding

 the metal surface created a potential barrier against further free electronic motions.

 Based on this hypothesis, he derived his "U3/2 law" - the space-charge-limited current

 was proportional to the 3/2 power of the voltage across the two metallic plates and to
 the inverse square of the plates' separation, i.e., I oc V3/2/d2 ("U" was Schottky's
 notation for voltage). He quickly found that the space-charge effect did not pose a
 limit to photoelectric currents at room temperature. But it was the dominant factor
 for currents emitted from heated cathodes, which meant that the U3/2 law was appli-

 cable to electronic tubes. As a result, he proceeded to investigate vacuum tubes. He

 measured the tube current and voltage with different cathode materials and filament

 temperatures. The voltage-current curves from his measurements were consistent with

 the U3/2 law, verifying his theory of the space-charge effect. Unfortunately, Schottky
 was not the first to discover this. Irving Langmuir at General Electric and Clement

 Child at Cornell University had independently found and published the same law in
 1913-1914. Schottky's paper came months later.8

 Schottky's experience with the U3/2 law shaped his future career on the studies
 of electronic tubes, semiconductors, and physical chemistry, leading to a conjunction

 in his work of basic and applied research. In 1914, he returned to Berlin to continue

 electronic-tube experiments at the University of Berlin. He presented his work on the

 U3/2 law in 1915 at the university's physics colloquium. The presentation impressed a

 Swedish physicist Ragnar Holm, who was attache at the university from the Siemens &

 Hauske Aktiengesellschaft - one of Germany's largest electric manufacturers and pio-
 neers of industrial research. (Siemens had sent research staff to scientific conferences

 and college colloquia to build connections with academia.) Holm invited Schottky to
 conduct research for Siemens. Like many German physicists at the time, Schottky

 was eager to help the nation win the ongoing World War with more "useful" work.

 Working for Siemens was thus preferable to pure scholarly research. Though still at the

 University of Berlin, he received funding from the company to build a laboratory for

 vacuum-tube experiments. Reckoning, however, on the increasing demand for military
 technology, he left the university in 1916 to work directly at Siemens Research and
 Development. In 1917, he assumed directorship of the "K Laboratory" of Siemens's

 general research establishment (the Werner-WerJcs Jur Bauelemente). 9

 Located in Charlottenburg near Berlin, the K Laboratory was Siemens's main facil-
 ity for the research and development of electrical devices used in signal transmission

 such as loading coils, vacuum tubes, and amplifiers. (K denoted Kabel , the German

 word for cable.) At the K Laboratory, Schottky led a team to develop screen-grid tubes,

 to invent superheterodyne reception (independent of the American inventor Edwin

 Armstrong who usually receives sole credit for its invention), to experiment on vac-

 uum tubes with multiple grids, and to investigate the properties of crystal detectors'
 metal-semiconductor contacts. These were critically relevant to improving German
 military communications.10

 The motivations for developing screen-grid tubes and heterodyne reception were to

 increase amplifier gain and to reduce external noise. Both concerns led Schottky to a
 question - is there a limit of amplification due not to individual device characteristics

 but to the fundamental physical principles governing the operations of all electronic
 devices? Building on his background in statistical mechanics, Schottky proposed a
 theory for the fundamental limit of electronic devices in 191 8. 11

 2.2 Shot noise in a resonating tube circuit

 Schottky began by noting that two kinds of noise due to electrons' fundamental charac-

 teristics posed limits to tube amplification: (i) electrons move randomly at any non-zero
 temperature; (ii) electrons are discrete. The first feature causes a random fluctuation

 in a supposedly constant current - "thermal noise" ( Warmeeffekt ). The second feature

 implies that a current is a discrete series of surges, not a continuous flow, and thus also

 causes a fluctuation in an apparently constant current - "shot noise" (Schroteffekt)}2
 Schottky decided to focus on shot noise. An electron flow's discrete characters are

 most conspicuous in a high- vacuum diode tube in which all electrons emitted from the

 cathode arrive at the anode. Schottky modeled the number of emitted electrons within a

 time duration r as a random process n (r ) . When the tube current is apparently constant,

 the average number of electrons per unit time is a constant N. Consequently, the elec-

 tron-number deviation from its average is An (r) =n( r) - Nr, also a random process
 depending on how electrons are emitted. Schottky assumed that the emitted electrons

 were uncorrelated with one another. Mathematicians had known that a random process

 with this property had a Poisson distribution. Hence An(z) must follow a Poisson pro-
 cess with zero mean and standard deviation Nr : (An(r)> = 0, {[An(r)]2) = Nr.13

 The number n(z) determines the tube's electric current. Since the number of elec-

 trons emitted from the cathode equals that arriving at the anode, the tube current
 within period r is i( r) = en(z)/r (e = 1.6 x 10~19 C is the charge of electron), and

 11 Schottky (1918, pp. 541-567).

 12 Ibid., pp. 541-547.

 13 Here the use of the term "random process" may be anachronistic, as the more comprehensive mathe-
 matical theory of random processes was not formulated until Andrei Kolmogorov's work in the 1930s. But

 the point here does not concern rigorous mathematical definitions or properties such as the existence of the
 probability density function over time. It instead concerns the intuitive characteristics of the random time-

 varying signal A/i(r). In fact, that An(r) has a probabilistic distribution at any instant and a correlation
 function between two instants - the basis of Schottky 's theory - are pretty consistent with the attributes of
 the random processes in today's definition.

 accordingly ([A/(r)]2) = e2N/r. The current's instantaneous value obviously
 fluctuates. An operator connecting an earphone to a vacuum tube with a DC bias would

 hear a hissing tone caused by the fluctuation - this is shot noise. The strength of shot

 noise is measured by the current's standard deviation ([A i (r )]2> . For a DC bias current
 i0 = eN, the effective "shot current" is is = [([A* (r)]2)]1/2 = io(e/io* )^2.14

 The above formula expresses the shot current of a diode vacuum tube alone. In
 reality, however, a tube is rarely used without being connected to other circuit ele-

 ments. Moreover, as we will see below, shot noise in Schottky's theory has a flat, fre-

 quency-independent "white" power spectrum, which leads to the unphysical outcome

 of infinite signal power if the bandwidth of the tube circuit is not limited. Therefore,

 Schottky considered the shot effect of an oscillating circuit with a diode vacuum tube

 in parallel with a capacitor (capacitance C) and a resistive inductor (inductance L and
 resistance R.) The RLC circuit forms a resonator that selects the tube's shot current

 at a specific range of frequencies (Fig. 1).

 To evaluate the noise current intensity of the circuit, Schottky used a method based
 on Fourier analysis. This method resembled a technique his mentor Planck adopted
 in treating black-body radiation in 1897-1898. The core of such a technique was
 performing an average over frequency to distinguish the slowly from the fast varying

 elements of the Fourier series, and attributing physical meanings only to the slowly
 varying elements (more details below).15

 2.3 A Fourier analysis of shot noise

 Schottky first wrote down the equation linking the current i into the tube with the
 current J out of the resistive inductor:

 d 2 J d J 2, 2.

 where coq = 1 /LC and p = R/L. If the tube current i is time harmonic with a single
 frequency, i = Ism(cot + <p), then the solution leads to the circuit's (time averaged)
 oscillating energy Es = (/2L/2)/[(l - jc2)2 + r2 x2](x = co/coq and r = p/coq).

 In reality, however, the tube current i is the randomly varying shot current, and (like

 other finite-duration, time- varying, non-monochromatic signals) can be expressed as
 a Fourier series sampled over a long period T :

 i - y, Ik = y, h sin(cokt + <pk)

 k= 0 *=0

 where cok = 2n k/T. Here the amplitude /* and phase (pk of each oscillating mode

 at frequency a)k vary randomly. As a result, the circuit's oscillating energy associated

 with the shot current is the sum over all the oscillating modes:

 00 00 r2 ,

 £s = X£* = LX" z 2j* (1 - 4) 2'2 + , r 22 (1)

 where jc* = cok/co o = 2nk/(o)oT ).

 The value of £s in Eq. 1 depends on the values of 1% for k = 0 to oo. According

 h = Y J i(t)sin(cokt + <pk)dt.

 But since i(t) = (i(t)) -I- A i(f), (i'(0> is a constant, and dtsin(cokt + = 0, the
 term corresponding to (i(t)) vanishes after the integral. Thus,

 Ik = jJ Ai(t)sin(o)kt + <p*)df.

 Merely plugging this expression of 4 into Eq. 1 helps little compute the oscillating
 energy Es , for A i(t) is a randomly varying signal. To facilitate such computation, a
 certain average is required, which Schottky did.

 Note that Schottky 's procedure of calculating average Es differed from today's stan-

 dard practice. A student of modern probability theory would base her computation on

 tools like ensemble average and correlation function. To her, the average oscillating
 energy {Es) is nothing but an ensemble average (with respect to the random configu-

 rations of { l' }). She would move the ensemble average into the summation in Eq. 1

 exchange the order of ensemble average and integrals in this expression, replace
 (Ai(t)Ai(t')) with a known correlation function of the random process A i(t)
 (a Dirac delta function 18 {t - tf) in the case of shot noise), and perform the integrals

 and summation accordingly. This is not what Schottky did. In contrast to the modern

 probability theory, his averaging procedure was carried out in the frequency domain.

 In other words, his average over random configurations was manifested in the form of

 average over Fourier spectral components. Schottky's apparently cumbersome proce-
 dure bore striking similarity to his mentor Max Planck's approach to the black-body
 radiation problem in 1897-1898. To understand better Planck's intellectual legacy to

 Schottky's 1918 paper, it is worth sketching the mentor's early treatment of black-body

 radiation, which Thomas Kuhn neatly reconstructed in his 1978 monograph.

 2.4 Techniques from Planck's work on black-body radiation

 Planck's overarching agenda in his research during 1897-1898 was to demonstrate
 irreversibility - the central characteristic of thermodynamics - in black-body radia-
 tion. To fulfill that aim, he considered a model with a spherical cavity (representing

 the black-body radiator) and a resonator sitting at the center of the cavity. The resona-

 tor served both as a portion of the black-body model and a measuring device. It had a

 resonating frequency vo and a damping constant p. Like any other resonator (such as
 an RLC circuit), this device had a frequency response resembling a band-pass filter,

 whose center frequency was vo and bandwidth proportional to p. In Planck's choice,
 p was large enough so that the resonator's bandwidth corresponded to the range of

 average over frequency, which was unavoidable for an actual measuring instrument.
 Thus, Planck's resonator was a device that generated measurable physical quantities.
 For this reason, he called it an "analyzing resonator."16

 When electromagnetic waves entered and reverberated in the cavity, part of

 their energy was absorbed by the resonator, which then underwent motion and
 re-radiated secondary electromagnetic waves. Planck expressed the axial component
 near the resonator of the total (primary plus secondary) electric field in terms of a

 Fourier integral:

 sented the frequency response curve of the analyzing resonator, as it took its maximum

 value at y = vo and diminished quickly beyond the bandwidth 2 p. Moreover, Planck

 According to Planck, the Fourier components A® , B^a^, in the equations for Jo
 and Uo all corresponded to measurable physical quantities, as they were the frequency
 components discernable by the analyzing resonator. However, they were expressed

 in terms of Cy+^CV sin(0v+M - 0V) and Cv+^Cv cos (0v+fl - 6V) determined by the
 amplitudes Cv and phases 0V of the electric field's Fourier components, which did
 not correspond to measurable physical quantities since they fluctuated too rapidly
 over frequency. As Kuhn commented, the electric field's Fourier components (repre-
 sented by Cv and 0V) in Planck's model resembled the non-measurable microstates in

 Ludwig Boltzmann's kinetic theory of gas, like the positions and momenta of individ-

 ual molecules, while the radiation intensity's and resonator energy's Fourier compo-

 nents A^, B®, a b^ resembled the measurable macrostates in Boltzmann's theory.
 Planck wanted to eliminate the "unphysical" Cv and 0V entirely and represented the

 measurable quantities A^, B®, b^ in terms of one another. To achieve that goal,
 he introduced an important approximation.

 What Planck did was to approximate the fast varying Cy+^Cy sin (0V+M - 0V) and
 CV+MCV cos(0v+M - 0V) with the slowly varying A® , . Specifically, he expressed

 Cv+AtCy sin(0v+M - 0v) and CV+MCV cos(0y+M - 0V) as

 Cv+iaCv sin 0y) = A^ -f- £ (v, /z),

 Cv+/>tCv COS(0y-|-^ 0y) = -j- ?y(v, fi).

 The function e and rj captured the fast varying parts of Cy+MCv sin(0v+M - 0V)

 and Cy+^Cy cos(0v+M - 0V). However, within the (sufficiently large) bandwidth of
 the resonator's frequency response curve sin2<$v, s , and r] changed so unsystemat-
 ically that their contributions from different frequency components cancelled one

 another. That is, f s sin2 Sv =f rj sin2 Sv = 0. This condition, coined by Planck as

 "natural radiation," guaranteed that the slowly varying physical measurables A^ and

 (obtained by averaging, with the resonator's frequency response, over neighbor-
 ing Fourier components of the actual field) could well approximate the fast vary-
 ing quantities Cy+^CV sin(0v+M - 0V) and Cy+^Cy cos(0y+M - 0V) corresponding
 to the Fourier components of the actual field. By replacing CV+MCV sin(0v+/x - 0V)

 and Cv+^Cv cos(0v+M - 0V) with A^ and B® in the expressions for a M and b M and
 employing the law of energy conservation, Planck established a differential equation
 relating Jo and Uo, dUo/dt + KvqUq = ( P/vq)Jq , which produced evolutions of Uo
 irreversible with time.18

 While fin-de-siecle physicists' (and Kuhn's) focus with respect to Planck's 1897-
 1898 papers was on the relationship between his natural radiation and Boltzmann's
 molecular disorder as well as Planck's clandestine introduction of statistical argument,

 his early work on black-body radiation nonetheless conveyed a more generic lesson:
 Instead of treating directly the rapidly varying Fourier components of a complicated

 physical quantity, we should work whenever we can on their averages over distinct
 windows of frequencies. In so doing, we actually smooth out the quantity's fine-scale

 fluctuations and transform spectral analysis into scales that are much coarser and hence

 more "physical" and much easier to handle.

 2.5 Replacing the ensemble with spectral average

 Schottky did not cite Planck in his 1918 paper (there was no citation in the article),
 but the Siemens researcher's approach followed closely the aforementioned lesson.
 Returning to the calculation of the shot current's energy Es in the resonating circuit,
 the summation in Eq. 1 represented a Fourier analysis. The energy spectrum in this

 expression contained a fast changing factor (with respect to frequency index k , not

 time) of l' and a slowly changing factor L/ 2[(1 - x^)2 + r2x%'. (The random and

 independently arriving pulses of the shot current made l£ fluctuate rapidly and spread

 over the entire spectrum; by contrast, L/2[(l - x%)2 -1- r2x^' was a smooth band-pass
 curve with maximum at jc* = 1 and bandwidth proportional to r.) Following Planck's

 generic lesson, Schottky treated these two factors separately by first averaging 1% over
 finer windows and then performing the summation over a coarser scale. Specifically

 he partitioned the set of non-negative integers k = 0 to oo into disjoint and consecutive
 windows [&i(l), &2(1)L t^i(2), &2(2)], [k'(n), k2(n)], ... Within the nth window,

 the factor L /2[(1 - x^)2 +r2x%] varied so little with k that it could be approximated by

 L/2[(l - *^o(/i))2 + r2xk0(n)]> w^ere kO{n) was an integer between k' ( n ) and ki{n).
 (A natural partition of this kind would be [0, K - 1], [^,2^ - 1], ..., [(n - ')K,nK -
 1], . . .., while the representative numbers £0(1 ), £0(2), . . ., k0(n ), . . . could be the

 mid-points of the intervals, i.e., K /2, 3 K/2, . . ., (n - 1/2) K, . . .) Consequently, Eq. 1
 could be approximated as follows:19

 The sum ^ *n exPression was supposed to average out the rapid fluc-

 tuations of l£. For this to be effective, the size of the window should be large enough to
 contain a sufficient number of terms; i.e., ki ( ri)-k' (n) 1 . On the other hand, the size

 of the window should be small enough - specifically, [k2(n) - k' (n)]/xkO(n) 1 - so

 that the function 1 /[(l - x%)2 + r2*^} varied little from k = k' (n) to k = k2(n).

 To evaluate the sum X^i(n) Schottky plugged in the relation /* =

 (Here the explicit denotation of k' 's and ^'s dependence on n is removed for conve-
 nience.) Then he approximated the double integral with a discrete double Riemann sum

 with short time increments At and At' . To justify this approximation, he argued that

 the resonating circuit's frequency response curve L/2[(l - xfy2 + r2x%' suppressed
 any high-frequency contribution from the double integrand, while the integrand's low-

 frequency components behaved like constants within the time windows At and At' , as

 long as they were much shorter than the circuit's resonating period. Thus, the double

 To evaluate the above double Riemann sum, Schottky grouped the terms in the sum
 into two clusters - those with identical time indices (t = t') and those with different

 time indices ( t ^ t'). The first cluster's sum is

 T

 ^ [Ai (OAf]2 sin 2(cokt + <pk).
 t= o

 The modern approach to evaluate this sum would be to calculate the ensemble average
 of the shot current's square to obtain ([A/(f)Af]2) = eioAt , and to plug the value

 back into the sum. Schottky did not do this. Instead of averaging over distinct configu-

 rations of the shot current, he worked on a single time series extended over a very long

 period T, and performed average over time based on an implicit ergodic assumption.

 Schottky observed that in the sum the factor sin 2(cokt + (pk) is periodic in time. Thus,

 within the very long period T , each distinct value of sin2(a^f +(pk) occurs many times
 in the sum. Group the terms with an equal value of sin 2(cokt + ^)(say, = sin2(^/o +

 <Pk)) together, it leads to sin2(a^o + cpk){[Ai (fy)]2 + [A/ ( t' )]2 + [Ai fo)]2 + • • -}At2,
 where to,t', ti are the instants at which sin 2(cokt + <pk) has the same value. Albeit
 with a coarser resolution, the sum {[A/ (ft)]2 + [Ai(t')]2 + [A i(*2)]2 + . • -}At2 can

 be considered as a kind of time average. Under the ergodic assumption, therefore, it
 equals ([A/(0Af]2) = eioAt for shot current. Thus, the first cluster of the Riemann
 sum becomes

 Since t and f ' represent distinct, non-overlapping time intervals, Schottky asserted that

 the shot current At (0 and A i (t ') within these intervals are uncorrected to each other,

 due to the mutually independent nature of randomly arriving shot electrons. Again,
 the modern approach would plug the correlation (Ai(f)Ai(f')) = 0 into the sum and

 obtain zero result. Although Schottky also aimed to get this result, his reasoning, with-

 out resorting to direct ensemble average, was more strenuous. He tackled the problem

 from the observation that unlike the terms [Ai (t) At]2 sin 2(cokt + <pk) in the first clus-

 ter, the terms Ai(t)AtAi(t')Atfsm(a)kt + (pk ) sin {a>ktf + <pk) in the second cluster

 are incoherent and do not exhibit any clear order. In fact, Schottky argued, because
 A i(t) and A i(t') are independent of each other, the factor Ai(t)AtAi(t')Atf varies
 randomly in a way so that it could be equally often positive and negative ("ebenso oft

 positiv wie negativ sein konnen"). The sum of such terms also randomly varies with
 the same frequency to be positive and negative, and the multiplication of the factor

 sin (corf + (pk) sin (a)ktf + (Pk) would not change this property. Moreover, he claimed,
 it is "well known" ("bekanntlich") that for p quantities of this kind with order of

 magnitude a , the order of magnitude of the sum of these p quantities is % fpa 22 Since
 the order of magnitude for Ai(t)AtAi(tf)Atf is less than ([Ai(f)Af]2) = eioAt , it

 follows from the stated theorem that the order of magnitude for the double sum cor-

 responding to the second cluster is less than [(7 / At)(T / At')]l/2eio At = T eio. Note

 that the double sum itself is also a zero-mean, randomly varying quantity over k. Hence

 we can apply the same theorem to the sum of the second cluster over k from k' to &2,

 and get an upper bound for the order of magnitude of the second cluster's contribution

 the contribution from the terms corresponding to t = t' (2/T)(k2 - k')eio. Con-

 sequently, 1% - (2/ T)(Jc2 - k')ei$. This relation suggested that the shot
 current's average power around frequency o)k is independent of frequency and hence
 corresponds to a "white" spectrum; specifically, = (! 2/T)eio23

 22 Ibid., pp. 558-559. Schottky did not prove nor provide citation information for this theorem. But it
 seems that it is an intermediate result in the proof of the law of large numbers: Suppose there are p iden-

 tical and independent random variables jq, JC2, . . xp with zero mean and variance (jc2) = a2. Define

 s = x' + *2 + • • • + xp. Then it can be shown easily that s has zero mean and variance ( s 2) = pa2. The
 root mean square of s, [(s2)]1/2 = can be interpreted as the "order of magnitude" of s.

 Why Schottky did not use the zero correlation (A i ( t)Ai (t )) - 0 to get rid of the second cluster straight-

 forwardly is not obvious in his text. The most likely reason is that he did not want to rule out the possibility
 that (Ai(t)Ai(t')) ^ 0 as t - tf was sufficiently small. Even though the zero correlation did not hold in
 that case, he might be convinced that he could still use the stated theorem to demonstrate that the order of

 magnitude for the second cluster was much smaller than that for the first cluster.

 2.6 The result

 Schottky substituted the shot current's white spectrum into Eq. 1 to calculate the cir-
 cuit's overall oscillating energy. He approximated the discrete sum with an integral
 and obtained:

 He gave the value of the integral /0°°djc/[(l - x2)2 + r2x 2] = 27r/r2, leading to

 the total oscillating energy Es = cc^Leio/p2. To transform this expression into a
 form directly comparable to the results from measurements, he argued that the energy

 Es = (o^Leio/p 2 is equivalent to the energy of the tube oscillator when the current

 i of the RLC circuit has amplitude'/2/s and frequency that is identical to the oscilla-

 tor's resonance frequency coo > viz., i = V2is sm(coot -1- (p ). The circuit's energy at its
 resonance frequency is Es = ( i2L/2)/r 2. Comparing both expressions, he obtained

 where r = Ijt/cdo is the circuit's resonance period. He also estimated the numerical

 scale of the shot-noise energy compared to that of the thermal-noise energy at room

 temperature, and found that shot noise is usually much stronger than thermal noise.24

 Schottky's theory of shot noise proposed an operable experimental condition to ver-

 ify its underlying hypothesis and gave a quantitative prediction for a measurable entity.

 Yet his work was not followed immediately. Schottky's article was published in June

 1918, when the war had consumed Germany and an unconditional capitulation seemed
 inevitable. Before the end of World War I in November 1918, vacuum-tube research

 was a top military secret not open to public discussions. After the war, Germany's

 political turmoil and economic depression interrupted normal academic activities and

 impeded the exchange of scholarly information with other countries. For these reasons,
 Schottky's work did not reach international scientific and engineering communities
 and even the German academia outside Siemens for years. Schottky himself did not
 continue the research on shot noise, either. As the war was over and a scientist's duty

 to serve the nation ended, he turned back to "pure" physics and left Siemens in 1919

 for the University of Wiirzburg.25

 3 Shot noise after Schottky

 Despite the mathematical tricks in ensemble and frequency averages, Schottky 's
 theory seemed to convey an elegantly simple idea: the random flow of discrete elec-
 trons in a thermionic tube gave rise to a kind of fundamental noise in electronic
 circuits. However, the situation became notably messier when the theory of shot noise

 was put into empirical test or more realistic modeling setup. In the experimental and

 engineering work on shot noise during the 1920s, more complex factors than those in
 Schottky's model had to be taken into account, and whether the shot noise posed a

 fundamental performance limit for electronic circuits was far from clear.

 3.1 Experiments with Schottky noise

 The Siemens researcher C.A. Hartmann made the first attempt to empirically corrob-

 orate Schottky's theory of shot noise. In 1920, Hartmann conducted an experiment at
 the K Laboratory to measure a vacuum tube's shot noise.26 His basic experimental

 setup was the same as Schottky's model in Fig. 1 : a vacuum tube connected in parallel

 to a capacitor and an inductor. The goals of his experiment were to verify (i) whether

 this circuit indeed had a noisy tube current, and (ii) if so, whether the noise intensity

 was consistent with Schottky's prediction in Eq. 3.

 Hartmann proposed a procedure to address the second goal based on the fact that

 Schottky's quantitative prediction involved the charge of the electron, e. He expressed

 Eq.3 as a relation of e with other variables, e = (if/io<Ho). This relation indicated
 that the ratio involving the measured shot current is , the tube's bias current io, and

 the circuit's resonance frequency coo should be a fundamental physical constant e =
 1.6 x 10"19 C.

 Though simple in concept, Hartmann's experiment was challenging in several

 senses. First, the tube had to be at a high vacuum to satisfy Schottky's assumption
 that all electrons leaving the cathode arrived at the anode. To fulfill this requirement,
 Hartmann designed a tube continually evacuated by a pump. Second, since the shot
 noise was tiny, the resonance circuit's quality factor should be very high to prevent
 signal dissipation. Therefore, he reduced the circuit's resistance so that cdqL /R > 150.
 Third, the tiny shot noise also meant that signals from the oscillating circuit should
 be considerably amplified. Here he used Siemens's high-gain multi-stage wideband
 electronic amplifiers.

 Making precise measurements of the shot current was also critical. Similar to radio

 atmospheric noise (atmospherics), shot noise was irregular and difficult to measure
 by common galvanometers. Thus, Hartmann adopted a comparative method similar
 to AT&T engineers' in atmospherics measurements. In his design, the vacuum-tube
 oscillator and a "reference" monotone generator tuned at the oscillator's resonance
 frequency were connected to a high-gain amplifier with a switch (Fig. 2). Like those
 in atmospherics measurements, Hartmann switched between the tube oscillator and

 the monotonic signal generator and adjusted the latter until the intensity from both

 Fig. 2 Hartmann's experimental setup (Hartmann 1921, Figure 8). The block on the left hand side is the
 vacuum-tube oscillator and the block on the right hand side is the monotone generator. The block "V*" is
 the high-gain amplifier. "U" is the switch connecting the three blocks

 sounded identical (to the experimenter) at the output earphone. Then the monotonic

 signal intensity, easily measured by a galvanometer, was taken as the effective intensity
 of the shot noise.27

 Hartmann used this setup to experiment with shot noise. His results were quali-
 tatively satisfactory yet quantitatively problematic. The instrument indeed produced
 hissing tones at the output earphone. Shot noise existed! He measured the effective
 shot-noise intensity for various resonance frequencies coo from 238.73 to 2387.33 Hz,
 with the bias currents i'o at 2 and 20 milliamps, and used the measured is to calcu-
 late the charge of the electron e. To his disappointment, however, the experimental

 results deviated significantly from Schottky's prediction. The problem was twofold:
 The values of e from the shot-noise measurements were all in the order of 10~22 C,

 1000 times smaller than its commonly known value 1.6 x 10~19 C from Millikan's

 oil-drop experiment. Also, the measured e varied with frequency, instead of remaining
 a constant (Fig. 3).

 Hartmann's experimental results were difficult to make sense if Schottky's theory
 was right. The experimenter's own explanation was that the emission of electrons
 from the cathode was not really a Poisson process. When an electron was emitted, a
 part of energy was taken away and the cathode was cooled down for a period. The
 lower temperature reduced the cathode's ability to further emit electrons. As a result,
 the actual number of emitted electrons was smaller than what the Poisson-process
 hypothesis expected. And the measured shot current (and hence the estimated value

 of e ) was smaller than Schottky's prediction.28 Yet no further research supported this

 physical picture.

 the value of e from shot-noise measurements (unit 10-22 C). The two curves correspond to io = 2 mA and
 20 mA (Hartmann 1921, Figure 9)

 The American physicist John Johnson found a more commonly accepted reason

 for the huge discrepancy between Hartmann's experimental data and Schottky's the-
 oretical prediction: a mathematical error. Born in Sweden, John Bertrand Johnson
 immigrated to the U.S., received a Ph.D. in physics from Yale University in 1917, and

 joined AT&T's manufacturing wing Western Electric's Engineering Department in
 New York. Johnson was among the first-generation of Bell-System researchers with
 advanced training in physics. His job at Western Electric was to develop the com-
 ponents of AT&T's transcontinental telephony. This brought him to the problems of
 noise.29 In 1920, Johnson read Schottky's 1918 article in Annalen derPhysik (the 1918
 issue did not reach America until 1920, owing to Germany's postwar postal delay).

 He was skeptical of Schottky's integral /0°°djc/[(l -x2)2 + r2x2] = 2yt/r2 forEq. 2.
 He tried to calculate the integral himself, but could not find a solution from the table
 of integrals. To solve the problem, he consulted a mathematician L. A. MacColl, who

 "suggested splitting the Schottky equation [the integrand] into four complex factors,
 integrating them separately and then recombining them [. . .] MacColl again looked
 at the equation and said this was a case for the method of poles and residues and,
 without putting pencil to paper, read off the correct result."30 With MacColl's help,

 he obtained the correct value of the integral /0°°djc/[(l - x2)2 + r2x2] = n/lr.
 He immediately wrote to Schottky and published this new result.31

 Johnson's mathematical exercise bridged the gap between theory and experiment.

 After receiving Johnson's letter, Schottky recalculated the integral with the help of his

 mathematician father and found Johnson right. Then he took Johnson's correction to

 recalculate the shot-noise energy Es , and thus the effective shot current is:

 leioR ,A.
 ,s=v^r (4) ,A.

 Consequently, e = ( ILi^/i^R ) instead of e = (if/*o&>o)- For the same i's, the new
 result e = (2L/|/i'o/?) gave an estimate of the e value approximately 1000 times
 larger than the calculation from the old result e = (/|/i'o<yo). After the correction,
 therefore, Hartmann's shot-noise data led to an estimate of e much closer to its actual

 value - the order of magnitude was right.32

 Nevertheless, the problem of e's frequency dependency still remained. The cor-

 rected data still yielded e values that varied with coo. In 1922, a Czech physicist
 Reinhold Fiirth at the University of Prague, expert on Brownian motion,33 explained

 this anomaly in terms of the "physiological" (or cognitive) nature of the experimental

 method.34 Fiirth argued that one could not take the results of noise measurements from

 the comparative method at their face value, for the method relied on the mediation
 of experimenters' aural cognition, a frequency-dependent feature. The comparative
 method required an experimenter to identify when the noise sound intensity equaled
 the monotonic sound intensity and to take the monotonic current as the measure of
 the noise current. Yet the two signals causing the same degree of aural perception in

 human ears had equal intensity if and only if the strength of human aural perception

 was proportional to the signal intensity (or, strength of stimulation) and the signals
 were at the same frequency. Both conditions were absent in Hartmann's experiment.

 The Weber-Fechner law in physiology states that the strength of (aural) perception

 s is in a logarithmic rather than a linear relation with the strength of stimulation V

 (signal intensity): s = c • log(V2/ Vq ), where Vo is a perceptive threshold (note 5 = 0
 when V < Vo-) While the reference signal in the comparative method is monotonic
 with a definite intensity, the noise to be measured has an extended spectrum with a

 random intensity. Accordingly, Fiirth revised the Weber-Fechner law for noise in a
 statistical-average form:

 sponds to DC bias current 2mA, the €2 curve corresponds to DC bias current 20 mA

 where s' is the strength of the aural perception stimulated by noise, W(V)dV is the

 probability that the noise intensity is between V and V +d V. Under Fiirth's assumption,
 the random noise intensity has a Rayleigh distribution W(V) = A • exp(- V2fl(V2)).
 Meanwhile, the aural perception si stimulated by a monotonic reference signal V'
 follows the original law S2 = 2c log(VyVb). In the comparative method, the experi-
 menters establish that si = S2 by equalizing the noise and reference sound. But unlike
 what Hartmann had assumed, s' = 52 does not entail that the mean noise intensity
 equals the reference signal intensity [(V2)]1/2 = V' . Instead, Fiirth's formulae for si

 and S2 shows that [( V2)]l^2/Vf is a function of V'/Vq. Moreover, the threshold Vq is not

 a constant, either - it is a function of frequency depending on the frequency responses

 of both the human aural perception and the amplifying-telephonic circuit.

 Ftirth obtained the empirical values of Vo at different frequencies from Hartmann's

 setup, and computed and plotted [(V2)]1/2/ V as a function of V'/Vq. From both,
 he constructed a relation between [(V2)]1/2 and V ', which he used to retrieve the

 noise intensity [(V2)]1/2 from Hartmann's data for the reference signal intensity Vf .
 Reinterpreting Hartmann's data led to new estimates for the value of e with a much

 slighter variation with frequency than the original estimates' - Fiirth's values deviated
 from 1.6 x 10"19 C within 100% (Fig. 4).

 Albert W. Hull and N.H. Williams at General Electric's Schenectady Research

 Laboratory in New York further improved the accuracy of the shot-noise experiment
 in 1924. As GE's expert on vacuum-tube circuits, Hull had developed multi-stage
 high-gain amplifiers using shielded-grid tubes in the early 1920s.35 These devices
 soon played an important part in the work of shot noise, in which he and his assis-
 tant Williams became interested. They attacked the shot-noise problem from the
 perspective of precise experiment, especially the determination of e from accurate

 35 Two years later, Hull's vacuum-tube amplifiers would achieve a gain 2000000 below 1 MHz. See Hull
 (1926, pp. 439-454).

 Hull and Williams's determination of e value from shot-noise measurements (Hull and Williams 1925,

 Table 2). The last column represents the estimates of e from measurements

 noise measurements. With the high-gain amplifiers, they could get rid of Hartmann's

 comparative method: They connected the amplified shot-noise current - now strong

 enough to be measured with more common means - directly to a crystal detector and

 a DC current meter that measured the mean square value of the shot current.36

 Hull and Williams used the new experimental setup to determine the value of e

 from the shot-current measurements. Working on a single frequency at 725 kHz, they

 obtained the experimental data leading to values of e extremely close to its canonically

 recognized value. Their estimated e at i'o = 1 - 5 mA had an error range of less than
 3% with respect to 1.6 x 10~19 C (Table 1).

 Hull and Williams did more than improve the experiment in order to come closer

 to the known value of e , however. They found a new factor that qualified Schottky's

 theory of shot noise - the space-charge effect. W.L. Carlson at GE's Radio Department

 had noted that a tube's noise intensity fell as the tube was more strongly charged. This

 phenomenon caught Hull and Williams's attention. At first, they believed that it was

 an artifact due to the reducing tube resistance. But they changed their mind when they

 still observed consistently low noise values after stabilizing the tube resistance. Now

 they thought that the reduction of the shot noise was caused by the accumulated space

 charge between the cathode and the anode; such space charge created a potential bar-

 rier against the flow of electrons. If the space charge inside a tube reached saturation
 after a sufficiently long time (the "space-charge limited" case), then all the relative
 motions between the electrons inside the tube disappeared and the electrons moved

 regularly in a uniform stream. In this case, the lack of randomness and discontinuity
 eliminated the shot noise. Schottky's theory of shot noise was valid when a tube's

 electronic current was limited only by its filament temperature - the filament's ability

 to emit electrons (the "temperature limited" case). When the current was limited by

 the tube's space charge, the shot noise was greatly reduced and Schottky's theory no
 longer applied.37

 3.2 Theoretical revision

 As Hartmann et al. worked on the shot-noise experiments, efforts were made to
 examine and to refine Schottky's theory. Schottky's theory of shot noise was built

 on statistical reasoning. Translated into mathematics, his problem was to solve a dif-

 ferential equation (the circuit equation) with a random source (the tube's shot noise)

 whose statistics were partially known. He solved the problem via a Fourier analysis.

 But his approach had shortcomings - its calculations were complicated, the physical

 meaning of each Fourier component was unclear, the assumption underlying the fre-

 quency average was questionable, and his spectrum of random noise lacked a rigorous
 definition. In the 1920s, physicists and engineers attempted to solve the shot-noise

 problem without resorting to the Fourier analysis.

 The Dutch physicists L.S. Ornstein and H.C. Burger at Ryks University (Utr-

 echt) were the earliest to revise Schottky's approach. In 1923, they claimed to solve
 the random differential equation in a more direct way. Key to their solution was to

 conflate the statistical average with the time average. In so doing, they considerably

 simplified the differential equation using integration by parts and obtained the mean

 square of the current J out of the resistive inductor: {J2) = e2n 2 + e2noy^l p. In
 this expression, the first term corresponded to the DC current and the second term

 corresponded to the current fluctuation, equivalent to Schottky's formula of £s-38

 The British physicist Norman Campbell made another attempt to revise the formu-

 lation. Aiming to explain both thermoionic and photoelectric emissions, he formulated
 a generalized principle that considered a series of identical events randomly occur-
 ring in time. An indicating instrument measures the effect of these events. Suppose

 0 = f(t) gives the instrument reading at time t after an event occurs at time 0, (An2)

 gives the standard deviation of the number of events in a unit time. Then the standard

 deviation of 6 is (AO2) = (An2) /0°° dt f2(t). This principle implied that the overall
 shot effect can be decomposed into a factor describing the statistics of the collection

 of electrons and a factor related to the waveform excited by an individual electron.39

 Thornton C. Fry at AT&T pursued further Ornstein and Campbell's reasoning fur-

 ther. A mathematician, Fry had taught at the University of Wisconsin and MIT before
 joining AT&T. In 1925, he assumed directorship of Bell Lab's Mathematical Research
 Department, where he built a staff of computing and mathematics to serve the firm's

 industrial research. A specialist in engineering probability,40 Fry thought that the major

 problem of Schottky's theory was the lack of a mathematically rigorous treatment of

 probability and randomness, and he was prepared to offer one of his own.

 Like Campbell, Fry began by considering a general case in which a measuring
 device detected current I and voltage E excited by independently arriving electrons
 in a long period T. Since the number of electrons within T is uncertain, the device's
 mean instantaneous power is {EI) = X^=o P(n)((EI)n), where p(n) is the probabil-
 ity that n electrons arrives within T and {(EI)n) is the mean instantaneous power of n

 electrons. That an electron's arrival is independent of others implies that p(n) follows
 a Poisson distribution p(n) = exp (-vT)(vT)n /n ' (v is the average number of elec-

 trons arriving in a unit period). Also, (( EI)n ) can be calculated from the assumption
 that the current and voltage excitation from the arriving electrons are additive. The
 additive formula can be expressed in terms of an iterative relation between ((EI)n)
 and {(EI)n-' ). Repeating the iteration n times led to (( EI)n ) = ((£/)]) + n(n -
 l)(£i)(/i). Substituting the expressions of ((EI)n) and p(n) into (EI), Fry obtained
 (EI) = (vT)((EI) i) + (vT)2(E')(I'). He interpreted (EI) as the system's overall
 power, (vT)((EI)') as the power of shot noise, and (vT)2(E')(I') as the power of
 the DC component. This implies that the shot-noise energy Es = v(w i), where w'
 is an electron's energy dissipated in the measuring device.

 The quantity (w') is the average energy generated in the measuring device by an
 electron traveling from the cathode to the anode of a vacuum tube. To facilitate the
 calculations, Fry modeled the tube as a parallel-plate condenser. A unit-charge par-
 ticle's movement from one plate to another induces a time- variant voltage v(t) and

 current i (t) across the plates. Consequently, (w' ) = e2 /0°° d tv(t)i ( t ). The quantities
 v(t) and i(t) depend exclusively on the circuit. In Schottky's theory, the circuit is a
 vacuum tube parallel to an RLC resonance network (Fig. 1). Fry modeled the tube as

 a capacitor, obtained v(t) and i(t), and substituted them into his formulae for E s. He
 found that Schottky's prediction for the shot-noise energy should be modified by a

 multiplicative factor [ 1 + R2 (C + Ctube) /L] , where R , L , C are the resonance circuit's

 resistance, inductance, and capacitance, and Ctube is the tube's effective capacitance.41

 3.3 Flicker noise

 Hull and Williams's experiment and Fry's theory inspired J.B. Johnson to research fur-

 ther into shot noise. In 1925, Johnson performed an experiment at Bell Labs to measure

 shot noise in the Schottky circuit using Hull and Williams's method (high-gain ampli-

 fier, crystal detector, and direct current meter). He compared his experimental results
 with Fry's revised prediction. His goal, relevant to AT&T in particular and to the
 electronics industry in general, was to find vacuum-tube circuits' performance limit

 imposed by electronic noise. Johnson measured the noise strength of the triode tubes
 from about 100 commercial electronic amplifiers of various kinds. His results con-
 firmed Hull and Williams's finding: the vacuum tubes of amplifying circuits operated

 at the space-charge-limited condition, so their shot-noise intensity was much lower
 than Schottky's and Fry's predictions.42

 In addition to that, Johnson discovered a new phenomenon. To test the general
 applicability of Schottky's or Fry's theory, he measured the noise of the diode tubes

 operating at the temperature-limited condition (i.e., without the space-charge effect).
 In the measurements, he changed the circuit's resonance frequency from 0 to 10 kHz
 to observe the variation of the measured noise intensity with frequency. This arrange-

 ment led to a novel effect: at high frequencies, the measured noise intensity was close

 coated filaments

 to Fry's prediction; but at low frequencies, the noise intensity increased rapidly with a

 decreasing frequency. This low-frequency deviation changed with the filament mate-

 rial. Between tungsten and oxide coated filaments, the latter had much higher noise

 intensity. With a tungsten filament, the ratio of the e value obtained from the noise

 data to the canonical one of 1.6 x 10" 19 C was 0.7 for frequencies above 200 Hz,
 but increased to 50 at 10 Hz. With an oxide coated filament, the ratio increased from

 1 at 5 kHz to 100 at 100 Hz (Fig. 5). It seemed that at low frequencies certain much

 stronger noise of a different kind superseded ordinary shot noise. Johnson named this

 new kind of noise the "flicker effect" for its special sound pattern.43

 Flicker noise, Johnson argued, differed fundamentally from shot noise. Its much
 higher magnitude implied that it was not due to random and mutually independent
 emission of discrete electrons. Since the flicker effect depended upon the filament
 material, its cause was related to the activities at the filament. A cathode surface

 changed continually with evaporation, diffusion, chemical actions, structural rear-
 rangements, and ion bombardment. These factors altered the filament's rate of elec-

 tronic emission, and the changing rate caused current fluctuations, the source of this

 44

 noise.

 Fry's revision of Schottky's theory, Hull and Williams's findings of the space-
 charge effect, and Johnson's discovery of the flicker effect at low frequencies opened
 up new directions for the shot-noise research in the rest of the 1920s. Following
 Fry's approach, Stuart Ballantine of the Radio Frequency Laboratory in Boonton
 (New Jersey) calculated in a more precise way the voltage and current excited by an
 electron between two parallel plates to determine shot noise's power spectrum in the

 temperature-limited case.45 After leaving General Electric for the Physics Department

 at the University of Michigan, Williams collaborated with his colleagues to improve

 the methods of noise measurements to determine more accurately the charge of elec-

 tron. In the space-charge-limited condition, they also used the experimental techniques

 to measure the charge of positive thermions and to examine the filament material's

 effect on charge emission.46 Schottky developed a theory to explain the flicker effect's

 frequency dependence. He assumed that the large noise intensity at low frequencies

 was caused by the fluctuation of the filament's electron-emitting capability owing to

 the coming and going of "foreign" atoms on the filament surface. Yet a foreign atom,

 once reached the filament surface, did not depart immediately; instead, it stayed there

 for a short period of time ta. Within this short period, therefore, the numbers of for-

 eign atoms at the filament surface at two distinct instants were close to each other;

 while such numbers fluctuated significantly with respect to each other if the separa-
 tion between the two instants far exceeded ta . In other words, the correlation function

 between the numbers of foreign atoms (which determined the correlation function of

 the filament's electron-emitting capability) at two instants separated by time t was not

 a simple impulse at t = 0 and zero otherwise, like the shot noise. Rather, it had a
 flat top within ta and fell off to zero (quickly or slowly, depending on the nature of
 atomic attachment and detachment) outside that duration. This non-trivial correlation

 function led to flicker noise's frequency dependence: (/flicker) oc f~n ( n was between
 1 and 2) 47

 These diverse studies revealed that noise was much more complicated than
 Schottky 's original theory in 1918 had expected. A vacuum tube was a microcosm with

 various physical mechanisms. Random emissions of discrete electrons could only par-

 tially explain the microcosm's fluctuations in a limited sense. Schottky's theory failed

 in the space-charge-limited case at which tube amplifiers operated. In the tempera-

 ture-limited case, the flicker effect dominated over the shot effect at low frequencies.

 Emission of ions, generation or recombination of ions and electrons, and lumping of
 charged particles all affected tube noise. Schottky's theory was a proper concept to
 start grasping electronic noise, but was by no means a useful framework to determine

 the fundamental limit of vacuum-tube circuits' amplification that engineers wanted.

 Then what was that limit?

 4 Thermal noise in resistors

 When Johnson conducted the shot-noise experiment in 1925 to seek the fundamen-

 tal limit of tube amplification, he measured the noise intensity and the gain of about
 a hundred commercially available triode tube amplifiers. He plotted the results in a
 Cartesian coordinates system (the ordinate was the gain and the abscissa was the noise

 45 Ballantine (1928, pp. 159-167). This approach culminated in a classic textbook on random noise written
 in 1958 by MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers Wilbur Davenport and William Root. See Davenport and

 strength) and found an interesting pattern (Fig. 6). The points representing various

 amplifiers' gains and noise levels distributed to the right of a sloped straight line pass-

 ing the origin. That is, for a fixed amplification, the noise intensity was always higher

 than the value given by the sloped line, meaning that the line represented the lower

 bound of the amplifiers' noise intensity. This minimum noise intensity was the residual

 tube noise when the disturbing factors were suppressed to the largest extent.48

 4.1 Johnson's inquiry

 What was the physical significance of the minimum noise represented by the sloped

 line in Fig. 6? At first, Johnson thought it was Schottky's shot noise without the space-

 charge effect and the flicker effect. But he changed his mind after noting a fact: since a

 sloped line passing the origin represented a proportional relation, the minimum output

 tube noise strength in Fig. 6 was proportional to the tube amplifier's gain. This implied
 that a tube's input noise strength was a constant when its output noise was a mini-
 mum. If so, then the minimum residual noise had nothing to do with the vacuum-tube

 amplifier itself. Rather, it was determined only by the amplifier's input condition.

 To testify this hypothesis, he put a resistor at the input of an amplifying circuit and

 changed its resistance to observe whether the output noise strength varied accordingly.

 It did, and the measured noise intensity was proportional to the input resistance. This
 resistor-dependent noise reminded Johnson of a less discussed aspect of Schottky's
 1918 article - thermal noise. Was the residual noise a result of electrons' thermal

 agitation at the amplifier's input resistor? Informed by this assumption, Johnson mea-

 sured the noise of the least noisy amplifiers with input resistors different in temper-

 ature, size, or material. The measured noise intensity was proportional to the input

 resistor's temperature only, not size or material. This strongly suggested that the min-

 imum residual noise was a fundamental physical effect related to the input resistor's

 thermal agitation.49

 In 1926, Johnson performed a systematic experiment on thermal noise at Bell Labs

 with his assistant J.H. Rohrbaugh. His focus now shifted from tubes to resistors. His

 circuit consisted of a resistor connected to a six-stage tube amplifier with the output
 coupled to a thermocouple for current measurements (Fig. 7). The high-gain ampli-

 fier suppressed the shot noise, the flicker noise, and other fluctuating effects to the

 maximum extent, and was shielded against external electric, magnetic, acoustic, and

 mechanical shocks. The input resistor was in a constant-temperature bath. The aim of

 the experiment was to determine the mean square voltage ( V^> of the thermal noise at
 the input resistor from the mean square noisy current (I2) measured at the amplifier's

 output via the relation (I2) = Y2{V2i)(Y was the ratio of the amplifier's output current
 to its input voltage).50

 Johnson's experiments in 1926 reached the same but more expressive conclusion:

 The ratio of thermal noise's mean square voltage to the input resistance {V^)/R was
 independent of the resistor's shape and material. Johnson tried different materials with

 identical resistance including metal wires, graphite, thin metal films, films of drawing
 ink, and electrolytes such as NaCl, CUSO4, K2C1O4, and Ca(N(>3)2. All yielded the

 same measured values. Also, the ratio (V^j/R was proportional to the resistor's abso-
 lute temperature. At room temperature, a 5000-ft resistor had (V2)/R = 10~18 W. He
 obtained thereby an empirical formula for the thermal noise: (V2)/R = ( I2)/(Y2R ) =
 KT (K was a proportionality constant).51

 As Johnson continued the experiment, he was obliged to revise the empirical for-
 mula for thermal noise (I2) = KTRY 2, since both the band-pass amplification Y
 and the input resistance R were functions of frequency. To incorporate the frequency-

 dependent feature, he suggested that (I2) = KT /0°° dcoR(co) ' Y ( co ) |2. Then he com-
 pared the measured data with the empirical formula. He determined the amplification

 'Y(co)'2 by measuring the amplifier's input-output characteristics. The input resis-
 tance R(co) was the real part of the amplifier's input impedance, which was modeled

 as a resistor Ro connected in parallel to a capacitor C. By substituting the measured
 | Y (co) |2 and the modeled R(co) into the empirical formula, he obtained an estimate of

 {I2) from numerical integration. The measured {I2) varied in the same pattern as the
 estimated (I2) had predicted. Johnson's formula seemed right.52

 4.2 Nyquist's theory

 That the formula was empirically adequate did not satisfy Johnson; he was curious
 about the theoretical foundation of his formula. In 1927, he brought this issue to
 his colleague Harry Nyquist at AT&T Development and Research, another Swedish

 immigrant with a Ph.D. in physics from Yale.53 To explain Johnson's formula, Nyquist

 spent a month developing a theory based on electric circuit analysis, thermodynamics,
 and statistical mechanics.54

 According to Schottky, thermal noise is fluctuations generated by electrons' random

 thermal motions in a conductor. Its simple relation with temperature indicates that it is

 a thermodynamic phenomenon. Thus, Nyquist's theory begins with a simple scenario
 at thermal equilibrium - two identical conductors (I and II), each with resistance R ,

 connected together by perfectly conducting wires and at temperature T. Electrons in

 the two conductors undergo continual thermal agitation as long as T is not zero. The
 thermal agitation in conductor I induces an electromotive force on the entire circuit,

 including conductor II. The electromotive force yields a current around the circuit. The

 current heats conductor II, and hence transfers power from conductor I to conductor II.

 In the same manner, power is transferred from conductor II to conductor I. At thermal

 equilibrium, power transferred from I to II equals that from II to I.55

 Nyquist contended that at thermal equilibrium, not only the total power but also the

 power at any frequency exchanged between conductors I and II equals each other.56
 This shows that the thermally agitated electromotive force is a universal function of

 frequency, temperature, and resistance - like other thermodynamic functions. Its form

 does not change with physical setups not involving frequency, temperature, and resis-
 tance. Thus, Nyquist considered a different setup with the two conductors connected

 53 Mindell (1996, p. 207).

 54 Nyquist (1927, p. 614).

 55 Nyquist (1928, p. 110).

 56 If not, a contradiction ensues. Suppose that conductor I sends more power to conductor I than it receives
 from conductor II in a frequency band. Then it sends less power to II than it receives from II in the rest
 of the frequency spectrum, for the total power from I to II equals that from II to I. When a resonance

 circuit blocking the energy transfer in the frequency band is set between the two conductors, the total power

 transferred from I to II equals the power from I to II without the resonance circuit less the power in the
 frequency band. Similarly, the total power from II to I equals the power from II to I without the resonance

 circuit less the power in the frequency band. With the resonance circuit, therefore, the total power from I
 to II is less than that from II to I, a contradiction to thermal equilibrium. So the assumption that the power
 transfer in the frequency band is unbalanced is wrong.

 Fig. 8 Nyquist's scenario for thermal-noise calculation (Nyquist 1928, Figure 3)

 by a long non-dissipative transmission line with length / (Fig. 8). The transmission line

 has inductance L and capacitance C per unit length so that its characteristic impedance

 (L/C)1/2 equals R , meaning no reflection at both ends. At thermal equilibrium, two

 trains of energy traverse the transmission line - one from left to right being the power

 of the thermal agitation from I to II and the other from right to left being the power of

 the thermal agitation from II to I.

 To calculate the transferred power, Nyquist isolated the transmission line from

 the conductors at t = 0 by short-circuiting its two ends, trapping the energy on the
 line. The transmission line containing the energy transferred from both conductors

 resembles Planck's black-body radiator. It is a resonator with modes of vibration cor-
 responding to stationary waves. The modes of vibration have frequencies nv/2l ( v
 is the speed of the energy transfer and n is a positive integer). Since I is long, the
 number of vibrating modes (degrees of freedom) is huge and can be represented as
 an approximately continuous function of frequency: the number of modes between /

 and / + df is 2ldf/v. For so many vibrating modes, the energy distribution follows

 Boltzmann's law: each degree of freedom has the mean energy kT (k = 1 .372 x 10~24

 J/K is Boltzmann's constant). Therefore, the transmission line's mean energy between

 / and / + df is 2 IkT d f/v. This is the mean energy within (/, / 4- df) transmitted

 from the two conductors to the line during the transit time I /v. This implies that the
 mean power each conductor transferred within (/, /+d/)isP(/)d/ = (2lkTdf/v)/
 (21 /v) = kTdf.

 From the power spectrum P(f) = kT, Nyquist obtained the electromotive-force
 spectrum E(f ): The electromotive force E(f)df generates a current I(f)df =
 [E(f)/2R]df in the circuit comprising conductors I and II. The power spectrum is
 therefore P(f) = I2(f)R = [E2(f)/4R]. This relation, along with P(f) = kT,
 implies E2(f ) = 4RkT, which expresses the electromotive force induced by the
 thermal agitation of a resistor with resistance R and temperature T. Nyquist extended

 this relation by considering the thermal effect of a passive network with a frequency-
 dependent impedance Z(/) = R(f) -I- iX(f). From circuit theory, he showed that
 E2(f ) = 4 R(f)kT.

 In Johnson's experiment, E2(f)df is the mean square thermal voltage between /
 and / -I- df at the amplifier's input. That is, the mean square thermal current between
 / and / + df at the amplifier's output is E* (f)'Y(f)'2d f ( Y(f ) is the ratio of the
 amplifier's output current to its input voltage at frequency /) and the overall output

 Nyquist tested his formula with Johnson's experimental results. Key to his test

 was Boltzmann's constant k. Johnson had data for R(co ), Y((jo), T, and (/2). Nyquist

 calculated k from this data using Eq. 5 and compared the results with its standard
 value k = 1.372 x 10~24 J/K. The outcome was satisfactory: the estimated value of k

 from the thermal-noise measurements was only about 7.5% below the standard value.

 Johnson attributed this discrepancy to the inaccuracy of the amplifiers' gain.58

 Johnson and Nyquist's theory of thermal noise had practical implications for elec-
 tronic circuit design. Equation 5 showed that the thermal noise increased with the

 input resistance, the input resistor's temperature, and the amplifier's bandwidth. As a

 consequence, Johnson argued, there were three practical means to suppress an ampli-
 fier's thermal noise - to reduce the device's temperature, to restrict the amplifier's

 input resistance (the resistance between the first-stage tube's grid and filament), and

 to make the amplifier's bandwidth no greater than needed.59

 5 Conclusion: engineering treatment of electronic noise

 By the 1930s, radio engineers had known two kinds of electronic noise - thermionic
 tubes' shot noise (including the flicker effect) and resistors' thermal noise. Although
 device defect or malfunction still mattered, such electronic noise became more and

 more critical in determining the performance limit of electronic devices as the device

 quality improved. Also, the originally tiny shot and thermal noise was considerably
 magnified as the tube amplifiers' gains increased significantly. For cutting-edge radio
 receivers free from most quality problems, shot and thermal noise seemed to pose the

 "ultimate" limit of signal amplification.

 Schottky's, Hartmann's, Hull and Williams's, Johnson's, Nyquist's, and others' sci-

 entific research into shot and thermal noise provided engineers with the means to push

 forward the envelope of the "ultimate" performance limit of electronic devices. Shot
 noise and flicker noise occurred only when a thermionic tube had zero or little space

 charge. As the tube's filament temperature was high enough to saturate itself with
 space charge, the tube current became coherent and the random emission of discrete
 electrons did not cause current fluctuations. Thermal noise was the result of the thermal

 agitation in an amplifier's input resistor. It was saliently suppressed if the amplifier's

 input stage had a low resistance and was maintained at a low temperature.

 Yet engineers found the guidelines from the scientific theories of noise inadequate.

 According to the theories, a tube amplifier with zero input resistance and high filament

 temperature had zero output noise. In 1930, F.B. Llewellyn at Bell Labs measured the
 noise of tube amplifiers with zero input resistance and high filament temperature.

 Under this almost perfect condition, however, the measured output noise intensity was
 still conspicuous. The discrepancy between theory and experiment made Llewellyn
 think about the real limit of amplification. He proposed three possible causes for the

 output noise with zero input resistance and space-charge-limited tubes. First, the shot

 effect still existed at space-charge saturation, since the space charge only diminished
 rather than eliminated the emitting fluctuation's influence. Second, even at zero input

 resistance, electrons traversing a tube still had thermal agitation, and their noisy effect

 could be represented by an internal resistance at the tube's plate. Third, the traversing
 electrons ionized air in the tube, and the secondary charged particles from ionization

 bombarded the tube's electrodes to create some output current fluctuation. Unfortu-

 nately, the effects of shot noise at the space-charge-limited condition, thermal noise of

 the plate resistance, and noise from ionization were difficult to analyze theoretically

 or quantitatively.60

 Llewellyn's discovery showed that electronic noise was more complex than
 Schottky et al.'s theories could capture. The shot-noise and thermal-noise models
 derived from fundamental electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, and thermodynam-

 ics were replaced by pictures of tangled interactions between charged particles and
 electronic tubes' physical setups. Research into the field in the 1930s indicated that a
 more accurate understanding of noise could only be achieved by studying the compli-

 cated details of electronic physics in thermionic tubes.

 Engineers could not wait until physicists confidently grasped the phenomena. Even

 though physicists could obtain a theoretical understanding of the noise, as Johnson and

 Llewellyn remarked in 1935, "the greater part of the noise in practical tubes is caused

 by things that have not been included in theory and that are still in a state of flux."61
 More than a fundamental limit of noise in ideal tubes, engineers needed to know the

 noise strength in real tubes for designs and operations. And they needed a practical,

 systematic method to obtain such information. Measurement was perhaps the only fea-
 sible way. Built on Johnson and Llewellyn's work, engineers at Bell Labs developed a

 scheme to experimentally characterize the tube noise strength. They measured a tube's

 noise intensity under various operating conditions and, most importantly, when the
 tube's grid (input) was short-circuited to ground. Under the short-circuit condition,
 the tube's input resistance was zero and the measured values were treated as the tube's
 intrinsic noise levels. This measure, called the tube's "noise figure," was represented

 by the thermal noise of an effective resistor at the tube's input. The noise-figure scheme

 offered a systematic method to rate off-the-shelf thermionic-tube devices. Throughout
 the 1930s, American, British, and German radio engineers studied, measured, rated,

 and published the noise figures of commercial electronic tubes.62 Systematic measure-

 ments inspired by, but independent of, noise physics became the canonical engineering
 treatment of electronic noise.

 Physicists' research into electronic noises contributed to engineers' endeavors to

 tame uncertainties in electronic circuit designs and operations, but not necessarily in
 the way they had anticipated. The discoveries of the shot, flicker, and resistive ther-

 mal effects helped engineers to understand noise's fundamental nature. The theories of

 these effects provided noise-reduction guidelines (increasing the filament temperature,

 reducing the input resistance, etc.) engineers often used. Yet Schottky's and Johnson's

 original hope to find the ultimate limit of amplification posed by noise diminished
 after the more complex physical processes inside electronic tubes were found. The
 theories of shot noise and thermal noise could not predict electronic noise. To obtain
 the electronic-noise data useful to radio engineering, systematic measurement was
 still the only viable method in the 1930s. This does not mean, however, that noise

 physics was irrelevant as engineers chose to characterize electronic noise with mea-

 surements - a practical art - instead of with predictions. Rather, the theories shaped

 the measuring methods. The noise-figure scheme, for example, was built on the theory

 of thermal noise at both the operational level (short-circuiting the input resistor) and
 the representational level (representing the noise with effective resistance).

 The electronic-noise studies sought a new kind of engineering knowledge - a tech-

 nology's fundamental limitation - from the assistance of physics. To grapple with
 electronic noise, one of the most common uncertainties in electrical devices, the Ger-

 man and American physicists and engineers aimed to characterize the upper bound
 of ideal devices' performances, not the actual performances of real devices. Con-
 ceptually, they focused on the ideal-type devices free from "human factors" - flaws,

 defects, unsatisfied qualities - so that the performance imperfection was caused by
 the devices' fundamental working principles and hence posed an intrinsic limit to
 the real devices of the same kind. Using statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, cir-

 cuit theory, and electrodynamics, they constructed theories to predict such an upper
 bound. Underneath these theories was the conviction that the random Brownian-like

 electronic motions generated fluctuations of performance at electrical devices. There-

 fore, the physical quantities (such as voltage and current) and the abstract engineering
 entities (such as signals) were represented by stochastic variables and the measurable

 noise effect was the result of the variables' statistical behavior. In so doing, the engi-

 neers and physicists converted the technological systems they were dealing with to
 models of stochastic systems.

 The noise studies of the 1920s-1930s did not fulfill their goal. Experiments showed

 that neither shot noise nor thermal noise posed the ultimate limit to vacuum-tube ampli-

 fiers. Other kinds of noise were present even when the Schottky effect and the Johnson

 effect were null. A thermionic tube, a complex microcosm with many types of elec-

 tron-material interactions, did not achieve its optimum state simply by eliminating shot

 noise and the input resistor's thermal noise. Failing to fulfill their goal, however, did

 not make the theories of noise useless to engineers. The theories might not be adequate

 in explaining or predicting. But they gave engineers a language to talk about noise.
 From the theories, engineers gained intellectual tools to make sense of, to quantify,
 and to define electronic noise.
